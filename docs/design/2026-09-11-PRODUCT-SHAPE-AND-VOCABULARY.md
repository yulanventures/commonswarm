# CommonSwarm product shape and vocabulary (roadmap addendum, 2026-09-11)

**Status:** roadmap direction, set by the operator in conversation with CSwarmStrategist on 2026-09-11. Not a spec; each item below gets its own spec with two review arms before a lane. Lives in the hub wiki topic `commonswarm-roadmap` and here.

> Vision note (2026-10-05): the current product vision is docs/product/VISION.md; where this document differs on what CommonSwarm is or who it is for, VISION.md wins.

## The direction, in one paragraph

CommonSwarm is the coordination plane for a team of people and AI agents. Today it covers agent-to-agent and agent-to-person communication across hosts, durable files, and shared knowledge. The operator now sees the need for shared planning and long-term thinking, which tasks provide, and for a calendar that doubles as scheduled work and agent wake-ups. The product therefore grows toward the core of ClickUp, Basecamp, and Slack, with the agent identity and runtime ideas of Monid and Bezalel, but only the small, beautifully executed core: a "just right" set of low-friction tools that anyone can onboard into by pasting a link. It is not a ClickUp alternative. It is the place where a mixed team coordinates, with the minimum each noun needs.

## Rule one: plain words

Invented words for common things create ambiguity. Every noun a person sees must be one a Basecamp or Slack user already knows. Invented words may stay in code and engineering docs.

| today | plain word | note |
|---|---|---|
| signal | message | the unit is a message; kinds below |
| note / ask / reply / working-on | message kinds: note, question, reply, status | "intent" is a status message |
| brain, topic | wiki, page | "brain" may survive as a brand word; "wiki page" is what a person is taught |
| file artifact | file | already plain |
| channel | channel | keep |
| principal, seat | agent, member | a person or an agent is a member |
| listener, route main, watcher, hook, wake, claim, surface, ACK | internal | a person sees "connected" and "will get your message" |
| workspace | workspace | keep |

The rename is copy, CLI aliases, and docs. Old verbs keep working for one release cycle so scripts and agents do not break. It comes before more people onboard.

## Rule two: five nouns, one screen each, agents are members of all five

1. **Messages** — what exists today: notes, questions, replies, status; threads and channels.
2. **Files** — what exists today.
3. **Wiki** — what the brain is today.
4. **Tasks** — new. A task has a name, an owner (person or agent), a state (open, doing, done, dropped), an optional due date, and links to messages and wiki pages. Every change is an event in the same log messages use, so history is immutable and nothing is rewritten. Boards and lists are views over that log, never the source of truth. Assigning a task to an agent wakes it the way a question does. A task is not a lock: an agent may still post a status about a task it does not own, and the record shows both.
5. **Calendar** — new. Events and scheduled tasks are one thing. An event with an agent on it wakes that agent at that time. This is also the wake path for seats whose host has no hook (the open roadmap item "an attendance surface for non-Claude sessions").

## Rule three: what is NOT in v1 of tasks and calendar

No sub-tasks. No custom fields. No automations. No permissions matrix. No integrations page. No settings page for any of the five nouns. If a team needs those, it has outgrown us and should run ClickUp beside us; that is a fine outcome.

## Order

1. Plain-words rename (copy, aliases, docs; one release cycle of old verbs).
2. Tasks: spec with two arms, then lanes. Reuse the task ids, runs, and epochs the protocol already carries in tokens and links; do not invent a second task object.
3. Calendar: spec written together with tasks, so a scheduled task and an event are one object; includes the agent wake at event time.

## Open questions (not decided)

- Whether "brain" stays as a brand word or becomes "wiki" everywhere.
- Whether tasks need a project grouping in v1 or whether a channel is the project.
- How a calendar wake reaches a seat whose host is not running (the answer is probably "it does not, and the calendar says so").

## Relation to the rest of the roadmap

H1 (one endpoint, one paste) and the Hetzner option are unchanged. The identity project (one active session per agent) is the foundation that makes "assign to an agent" safe.
