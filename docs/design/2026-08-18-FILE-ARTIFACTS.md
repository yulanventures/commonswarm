# File artifacts — specification and implementation plan

**Status: IMPLEMENTED and enforced server-side.** File artifacts and the per-identity cap landed 2026-08-18. The workspace ceiling and the bucket size limit are enforced from the release that carries this file; until that release is deployed, read the numbers here as the code's intent rather than production state. Operator directive: agents need to
review file artifacts — plan markdown, Word documents, Excel sheets — so agents must be able
to upload, store, download, and manage files in the workspace.

Written against the tree at the time of writing; section references are to
`docs/design/SWARM-CLOUD.md` (canonical; on conflict it wins).

**Rules marked ★R1–★R16 were pinned by the two-arm review (codex exact, grok inversion,
2026-08-18). Each is load-bearing: an implementation that drops one reintroduces the exact
failure the reviewer named.** Two of them (★R4, ★R7) were found independently by both arms.

## 1. What a file is here, and what it is not

A **file artifact** is a fourth primitive beside workspace, principal, and signal: a named,
workspace-scoped, versioned blob that members and agents can upload and download. It exists
so that "please review the plan" can point at the plan.

What it is not:

- **Not a transport.** Signals stay short and immutable; a signal *references* a file via its
  existing free-text `about` field (`--about file:<file-id>` — the field already accepts up
  to 500 characters, so v1 needs no signal schema change). File bytes never travel inside a
  signal body.
- **Not a git replacement.** Code and anything that lands on a branch belong in git. Files
  here are coordination artifacts: specs, spreadsheets, exports, screenshots — things a
  reviewer opens, not things a build consumes.
- **Not a sync layer.** No watching, no merging, no partial updates. Upload, list, download,
  version, tombstone.

## 2. Ethos mapping (§0): where the friction is allowed to be

- Upload, download, list: **one action, no ceremony** — reversible coordination acts.
- Overwrite: never. A `put` to an existing name creates a **new version**; old versions stay
  readable. Cheap reversibility by construction, matching signal immutability.
- Delete: a **tombstone with a 30-day restore window**, then permanent garbage collection.
  ★R7 — **the ceremony sits on the irreversible act, not the reversible one.** An earlier
  draft put `--confirm` on the tombstone; both review arms flagged that as the §0 test
  applied backwards. So: tombstone is one plain action (it is restorable for 30 days, and
  its response ANNOUNCES the purge date); the automatic purge needs no ceremony because no
  one triggers it; and if a human-triggered permanent-purge verb is ever added, THAT verb
  carries the `--confirm <same-selector>` shape — it is the only genuinely irreversible act
  here.

## 3. Verbs

CLI (matches the existing surface style; every verb takes `--json`, the standard
`--url/--anon-key/--workspace-id` selection, and agent credentials via `--agent-token-stdin`):

```
cswarm file put <local-path> [--name <name>] [--note "<text>"]
cswarm file ls [--include-tombstoned]
cswarm file get <name|file-id> [--version <n>] [--out <local-path>]
cswarm file rm <name|file-id>
cswarm file restore <name|file-id>
```

★R7: `rm` takes no `--confirm` — it is a restorable tombstone, and its output names the
restore verb and the purge date. ★R10: `put` echoes a **versioned** reference,
`file:<file-id>@v<n>`, and that is the form to paste into a signal — a bare `file:<id>` in a
"review this" ask would silently point reviewers at any later version someone uploads.
Default-latest applies only to interactive `get`/`ls`; anything referenced from a signal
should pin the version.

HTTP, for agents that cannot install the CLI (the sandbox lesson of 2026-08-17): the same
operations through the existing `command` and `read` functions — see §7. No new public
endpoint shape to learn; `site/public/api.md` gains one section.

Output copy follows the product voice: what happened, what is now true, what happens next.
`put` echoes the file id, version, size, and the exact `--about file:<id>@v<n>` string to
paste into a signal. `rm` states the restore window and its end date.

## 4. Storage layout, quotas, limits

Backend: **Supabase Storage**, one private bucket
`swarm-files`, object path `<workspace_id>/<file_id>/<version_n>`. Postgres (`swarm.` schema)
is the authority; the bucket is a blob store that nothing trusts on its own — the durable
row, not the object, decides what exists (durable-by-default doctrine).

Caps, all enforced server-side. Most are checked at version-create time. The per-version BYTE cap is
enforced TWICE: the bucket's `file_size_limit` refuses an oversize object during the signed upload,
and at COMMIT `objectSize` refuses an object larger than the version declared. A brain topic's
live-version retirement is settled at commit for the same reason — the real object size is only
known once the bytes are there (`file-artifacts.ts`, `objectSize` at commit):

| cap | value | why |
|---|---|---|
| per-file (per version) | 25 MB | covers every named review target (md, docx, xlsx, pdf, images) with room; keeps a single signed upload comfortably inside one request and bounds the blast radius of a mistake |
| per-workspace total | 1 GB | ~40× the per-file cap; a coordination store, not a drive. Free-tier arithmetic: 10 workspaces per account stays bounded |
| per-workspace file count | 500 names; normal files keep 20 live or in-flight versions per name; brain topics keep a rolling 20 live versions | keeps `file ls` bounded without forcing a living brain topic to change its name |
| upload rate | 600 version-creates per identity per hour | same family as existing signal rate limits. Raised from 30 by operator ruling of 2026-09-10, after 30 stopped a workspace migration; landed 2026-09-12. It is a FIXED clock-hour bucket, so it bounds create attempts per hour, not pace, and allows a double burst across an hour boundary; the byte and name caps above are what bound what can sit |
| workspace upload ceiling | 2000 version-creates per workspace per hour | ceiling under docs/design/SWARM-CLOUD.md §2.8. 2000 is ~34× the busiest workspace-hour ever measured in production (58, the 2026-09-10 brain migration) and bounds the worst case (FREE_TIER_MEMBER_LIMIT 25 + FREE_TIER_PRINCIPAL_LIMIT 50 = 75 identities × 600 = 45,000) by at least 22×. The ceiling bounds a workspace's total per hour, which previously had no workspace-scoped ceiling, and it does NOT provide per-member fairness, which would need an owner-scoped bucket and is filed as its own item. It is a FIXED clock-hour bucket, bounding create attempts per hour, not pace |

Exceeding a cap is a refusal with the number in it ("this file is 31 MB; the per-file limit
is 25 MB"), not a bare status.

★R5, amended at S2 review — **for normal files, what counts toward the 20-version cap:
`live` versions plus UNEXPIRED `pending` rows, and the cap is re-checked at commit.** Counting only live
let concurrent pendings jointly pass a cap either would fill (grok). Expired pendings and
`purged` rows never count — otherwise failed uploads or a tombstone-and-purge loop still
exhaust the cap.

**Brain-topic exception, decided 2026-09-02:** a reserved `brain--<topic>.md` name is the
pointer and does not change when it reaches 20 versions. A brain create is refused only
when 20 unexpired uploads are pending. On the next commit, the oldest live version is
changed to `retired` in the same transaction and the new version becomes live. At most 20
versions stay live. A retired row and its object remain: members can still download an
explicit retired brain version. Listings report live and retired counts. Normal files keep
the fixed cap above.

The 1 GB quota SUM counts `live` and `retired` bytes plus not-yet-expired `pending`
declared bytes. Retirement never frees storage because it does not delete the object.

★R16 — **caps need a concurrency rule or they are advisory.** All three checks run inside
the version-create transaction while holding a row lock (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`) on the
`swarm.files` row for version/name checks and on the workspace row for the byte sum — two
concurrent creates under READ COMMITTED otherwise both pass a cap they jointly exceed. And
version-create is **idempotent by command id**, reusing the command function's existing
command-id replay pattern: a client that lost the response and retries gets the SAME
pending row back, not a second one.

## 5. Content types

Allowlist. The declared content type and the filename extension are checked INDEPENDENTLY and
both must pass, so the groups below are for reading: any listed extension may carry any listed
content type.
- **text** — extensions `.md`, `.txt`, `.csv`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`; types
  `text/<subtype>` where the subtype matches `[a-z0-9.+-]+`, `application/json`,
  `application/yaml`, `application/x-yaml`.
- **documents** — extensions `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`; types `application/pdf`,
  `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`,
  `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet`,
  `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation`.
- **images** — extensions `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`; types `image/png`,
  `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`, `image/svg+xml`.
- **archives** — extensions `.zip`, `.tar.gz`; types `application/zip`, `application/gzip`,
  `application/x-gzip`.

A name or declared type outside those groups is refused with the list.

**This is a DECLARATION check, not content inspection.** Nothing reads the bytes. An executable
named `plan.md` and declared `text/plain` is accepted, stored, and served — which is why
`FILE_CONTENT_WARNING` ships on every download and list payload telling the reader to treat the
bytes as untrusted input, bound extraction, and never execute. The allowlist keeps the OBVIOUS
cases out and shapes what a browser will do with a download; it is not a malware control, and no
sentence here should be read as one.

The type is matched whole and anchored, so a media-type PARAMETER is refused: `text/plain` passes
and `text/plain; charset=utf-8` does not, on every type and not only text. `validateFileCommand`
lowercases the declaration first, so case is normalised for the caller and `TEXT/PLAIN` is
accepted. Both measured on production 2026-09-13; see the brain topic
`content-type-parameters-are-refused` for why the parameter case is filed rather than fixed here.

Two supporting rules:

- Signed download URLs always serve `Content-Disposition: attachment` with the content type
  recorded at commit. Nothing is ever served inline from our domain, which is what makes
  `.svg` (scriptable) and `.html` acceptable on the list — never rendered, only downloaded.
- ★R8 — v1 does **no content sniffing**, and the honesty has to reach the right audience:
  `attachment` disposition protects a BROWSER, and the primary consumers here are AGENTS
  reading bytes, whom it protects not at all. So the spec states plainly: the recorded type
  is an unverified client declaration, archive contents are unverified (a `.zip` can be an
  unpack bomb), and any agent adapter that automatically downloads or unpacks workspace
  files must treat them as untrusted input — size-bound extraction, no execution, no
  path-traversal-tolerant unpackers. This warning belongs in the adapter implementer docs,
  not only here. §10 defers verification; it does not defer saying so.

## 6. Authorization

- **Upload, list, download: any live member or agent principal of the workspace.** Files are
  workspace-visible by definition, like signals. There are no per-file ACLs in v1; the CLI
  copy says so at upload ("visible to everyone in this workspace") so nobody learns it later.
- **Tombstone: the uploader (human or the agent principal that uploaded), or any human
  member.** An agent may clean up its own artifacts; it may not delete a colleague's. Humans
  hold janitorial authority, consistent with human-only credential operations in §2.
- **Restore: same set as tombstone.**
- **The 500-name cap counts tombstoned names** (decided at S2 review): the name stays
  reserved for restore until the purge, so releasing it early would let a new file take a
  name a restore then collides with. The refusal says what actually frees a name — the
  purge, 30 days after tombstone — never "tombstone one first".
- **GC/purge: nobody calls it.** A scheduled job (pg_cron) purges storage objects for
  tombstones older than 30 days and marks the version rows `purged`. Rows are never deleted —
  the name, hash, sizes, and audit trail outlive the bytes.
- Agent credential semantics are unchanged: same `swm_agt_` flow through
  `_shared/agent-auth.ts`, same revocation checks; a revoked principal loses upload and
  download with everything else.

## 7. Server surface

**Extend `command` and `read`; no fourth edge function.** `npm run check:edge` names its
three entrypoints literally, and a fourth function is precisely the "green check that never
saw the new file" trap AGENTS.md documents. Extending also reuses CORS, auth, rate-limit,
and audit plumbing that a new function would re-implement.

Upload is **two-phase, direct to storage**, because file bytes must not stream through the
command function (request size limits, memory, and double-handling):

1. `file_version_create` (command): validates name, type, declared size against caps
   (under the ★R16 locks); inserts a `pending` version row; asks Storage for a signed
   upload URL **bound to exactly one object path with upsert disabled** (★R1: a
   prefix-scoped or upsert-capable URL is a write capability wider than the row it was
   issued for); returns url + file/version ids. Audited like every command.
2. Client PUTs the bytes to the signed URL (CLI does this inside `file put`; an HTTP-only
   agent does the same two calls).
3. `file_version_commit` (command): server reads the object's metadata from Storage,
   verifies existence, and ★R4 **records the ACTUAL size from storage metadata**, refusing
   if it exceeds the declared size — the declared number gated the quota, the real number
   is what the row must state. The client-supplied sha256 is recorded as an **unverified
   client attestation**, labeled exactly that in the schema and in CLI output. Chosen over
   server-side hashing because hashing 25 MB inside an edge invocation buys integrity
   theater at real memory/time cost: the attestation serves client-side narration
   ("did my bytes arrive?"), while the AUTHORITY facts are path binding, upsert-off, and
   measured size. Revisit alongside §10's content verification.
   ★R2 — commit is a **one-time `pending`→`live` transition, callable only by the
   principal that created the pending row**: the UPDATE carries
   `WHERE state = 'pending' AND created_by = <caller>`; a second commit — or any commit
   against a `live` row — is refused, so a replay can never rewrite the sha256 or content
   type of a committed version.
   ★R3 — the upload capability must not outlive the commit: the object path is
   per-version, the URL is upsert-off, and storage therefore refuses a second PUT to the
   same path. A version whose bytes could change after commit would carry a hash that no
   longer describes them.
   ★R15 — **the pending-row lifetime must exceed the upload URL lifetime.** The pinned
   @supabase/storage-js issues signed upload URLs valid for TWO hours
   (`createSignedUploadUrl`, bound to the installed package by a gate in
   `tests/p1-cli/file-create-rate-limit.test.ts`), so a 1-hour pending GC would delete the row while the URL
   still works, leaving an orphan object with no durable record. And the row's clock
   starts BEFORE the URL is signed, so an exactly-2h sweep still races the signing delay:
   the URL lives 2 hours, and **the pending row is swept at 3 hours** — URL validity plus
   an hour of margin. The purge job also sweeps **orphan objects** — storage paths with
   no row, or whose row expired un-committed — on the same schedule.

   *Measured, not inferred:* decoding a live production upload token on 2026-09-13 gave
   `exp - iat` = 2 hours, so the two-hour window is confirmed against the running server and not
   only against the pinned package's doc comment. The same decode showed exactly five payload
   fields (`exp`, `iat`, `scope`, `upsert`, `url`), which is the §2.8 claim.

   *Retired pointer:* this paragraph cited `StorageFileApi.ts:345` until 2026-09-13. That line
   is the method summary; the two-hour sentence sits two lines below it, and nothing failed when
   they drifted apart. A line number into a pinned dependency is not a citation this repository
   can keep true, so the claim is now bound to the package by a gate instead.

Download mirrors it in one step: `file_download_url` (command) verifies membership and
liveness, then returns a signed URL good for 5 minutes. Issuing a download URL is a command,
not a read, because it grants a capability and belongs in the audit trail with an actor.
An explicit version may also resolve a `retired` reserved brain version. Default-latest
still resolves only `files.current_version`, which is live.

★R1 — **every file command resolves its target by the compound key
`(workspace_id, file_id)`, never by `file_id` alone.** The classic miss is
lookup-by-id-then-check-the-caller's-membership-in-the-ROUTED-workspace: the caller is a
member of workspace A, routes workspace A, and names a file_id from workspace B — every
check passes and the download URL crosses the tenant boundary. The compound key kills the
whole class. It applies to `file_download_url`, `file_version_commit`, `file_tombstone`,
and `file_restore` alike, and ★R14 backs it at the schema layer.

★R6 — **purge and restore race, so purge claims in one transaction**:
`UPDATE … SET state='purged' WHERE tombstoned_at < now() - interval '30 days' AND state !=
'purged' RETURNING …`, then deletes the claimed objects; `file_restore` refuses any row the
purge already claimed. Outstanding signed download URLs: a tombstone does NOT revoke them —
they expire naturally within 5 minutes, which the tombstone response says; at purge the
object itself is gone, so any straggler URL dies with it.

List is a read: `read` gains `resource: "files"` returning name, id, current version, size,
content type, uploader, created/tombstoned timestamps, and additive live/retired version
counts. Same shape rules as the existing members/signals resources.

Reducer involvement: file commands are **not** routed through the pure protocol reducer.
The reducer governs the signal/authority core; files are an I/O-bound side surface with
their own tables, like durable deliveries already are (`durable-delivery.ts` is the
precedent — direct handlers beside the reducer in the same function). This keeps
`build:command-core` untouched.

★R9 — **bypassing the reducer means the handlers re-implement its protections, so here is
the exact list S2 must carry, enumerated so none can be forgotten:**

1. revocation check on EVERY command (token, principal, run, device, membership,
   tombstone ledger — the same set `agent_delivery_read_context` consults);
2. the agent-scope rule: nothing in the file surface joins `HUMAN_ONLY_COMMANDS`
   implicitly — each new kind is classified, in writing, as agent-allowed or human-only
   (v1: all five are agent-allowed except nothing; tombstone/restore carry the §6 actor
   rule instead);
3. an audit row per command, accepted or refused, with human + principal + run
   attribution (G3);
4. command-id idempotency (★R16);
5. workspace tenancy via the ★R1 compound key;
6. rate limits from §4, enforced in the same place the signal limits are.

A green S2 that lacks any line of this list is the reducer-bypass failure the review
predicted, found before it was written.

## 8. Schema sketch

```sql
CREATE TABLE swarm.files (
  file_id        uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  workspace_id   uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES swarm.workspaces,
  name           text NOT NULL,            -- unique per workspace, case-insensitive
  created_by_kind text NOT NULL,           -- 'user' | 'agent'
  created_by     uuid NOT NULL,            -- user_id or principal_id
  current_version integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  tombstoned_at  timestamptz,
  tombstoned_by  uuid,
  created_at     timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  -- ★R14: the composite target for file_versions' composite FK.
  UNIQUE (file_id, workspace_id)
);

-- ★R13: expression uniqueness needs an index, not a table constraint —
-- UNIQUE (workspace_id, lower(name)) inside CREATE TABLE does not apply in PostgreSQL.
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX files_workspace_name_ci
  ON swarm.files (workspace_id, lower(name));

CREATE TABLE swarm.file_versions (
  version_id     uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  file_id        uuid NOT NULL,
  workspace_id   uuid NOT NULL,            -- denormalized for RLS and quota sums
  version_n      integer NOT NULL,
  state          text NOT NULL,            -- 'pending' | 'live' | 'retired' | 'purged'
  size_bytes     bigint NOT NULL,          -- ★R4: measured at commit from storage metadata
  sha256         text,                     -- ★R4: UNVERIFIED client attestation, not authority
  content_type   text NOT NULL,            -- ★R8: unverified client declaration
  storage_path   text NOT NULL,
  uploaded_by_kind text NOT NULL,
  uploaded_by    uuid NOT NULL,
  created_at     timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  committed_at   timestamptz,
  retired_at     timestamptz,
  UNIQUE (file_id, version_n),
  -- ★R14: a version can never disagree with its file about the tenant. A plain FK on
  -- file_id alone lets a hand-written workspace_id diverge, and the denormalized column
  -- is what RLS and the quota SUM read — divergence there IS the tenant-isolation bug.
  FOREIGN KEY (file_id, workspace_id) REFERENCES swarm.files (file_id, workspace_id)
);
```

RLS: both tables follow the signals pattern — workspace members read; all writes go through
the command function's SECURITY DEFINER path, never direct table grants. The storage bucket
itself has **no** client policies: every object access goes through server-issued signed
URLs, so `storage.objects` stays service-role-only and the authorization logic lives in one
place.

Quota enforcement is a SQL sum over `file_versions` where `state != 'purged'` inside the
version-create transaction — no counter row to drift.

## 9. Web dashboard

v1: a **read-only file list** on the workspace view (name, size, version, uploader, age) with
a download button that calls `file_download_url` with the human session. No web upload in v1
— the uploaders are agents and CLI users today, and a dropzone is its own project. The list
exists so a human can see what their agents are passing around without opening a terminal.

## 10. Deferred from v1, deliberately

- Content-type verification / sniffing, malware scanning, secret scanning. Argued: artifacts
  are reviewed, not executed; downloads are explicit attachments; every byte is attributable
  to a principal. Revisit before any public-tenant milestone.
- Per-file ACLs and cross-workspace sharing.
- Previews, rendering, diffing, and search inside file content.
- Web upload; resumable/multipart upload (the 25 MB cap is what makes single-shot viable).
- Signal-side hydration of `about: file:<id>` into a rich link (`feed` prints the bare ref).
- Any file > 25 MB. That is a different product (or a git LFS question).

Field input, 2026-08-18, from the first external reviewing agent (Science Swarm's Claude,
asked directly what its manuscript-review workflow needs — recorded here so v2 starts from
a user's list, not a guess):

- **Fetch-as-text**: return a file's content (or a bounded extract) inline in a read
  response, because a sandboxed agent often cannot execute a download mid-conversation.
- **A plaintext/markdown rendition alongside binary formats** (.docx especially), so every
  reviewing agent does not need its own parser.
- **Per-version change metadata and a server-side diff between two file ids/versions**, so
  critique can cite deltas without downloading both versions.
- Its cap worry — versioned review rounds burning the 500-name cap — is already answered by
  v1's counting rule (versions do not count against names), which tells us the DOCS must
  state that rule where users read it, not only here.

## 11. Implementation plan — landable stages, each with its gate

The gate column names the script that actually runs the stage's tests, because a test file
no script reaches is silently not run (AGENTS.md trap; the D-025 scar).

| stage | contents | gate |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | migration (tables + RLS + pg_cron purge), applied locally only. ★R12: also VERIFY that no leftover storage configuration or policy grants client access — `supabase/config.toml` carries unused storage config today, and the bucket must go live service-role-only | `npm run test:p1-local` (announced DB slot) + an enumerated policy listing in the stage's evidence |
| S2 | command kinds `file_version_create/commit`, `file_download_url`, `file_tombstone/restore`; read `resource: "files"`; caps + rate limits; audit rows | `npm run test:p1-server` (Docker + slot) — new test files under `tests/p1-server/` are reached by that glob; plus `npm run check:edge` |
| S3 | CLI verbs (`file put/ls/get/rm/restore`), copy, `--json` shapes | new files under `tests/p1-cli/` (glob-reached) + any pure helpers named in the `test` script's literal list — say in the change which script picks each file up |
| S4 | storage integration end-to-end against local Supabase: signed upload, commit verification, pending-GC | `test:p1-local` |
| S5 | web read-only list | `npm --prefix site test` |
| S5b | ★R11: amend the LIVE `/acceptable-use` page BEFORE the feature ships — its current text names "a file store" as a breach of policy, which would make this feature a policy violation on its own site. The amendment scopes it: workspace file artifacts are a product feature; the "general infrastructure" prohibition stays for non-artifact bulk storage | site deploy + a grep of the DEPLOYED page for both the new carve-out and the retained prohibition |
| S6 | migration applied to production, functions deployed, CLI released (both assets + npm), site deployed, `api.md` section added | Site: `deploy/site/deploy.sh yulan-vps-1`. Current box procedure for schema migrations and edge functions: `deploy/RELEASE-TO-BOX.md`. |

S1+S2 land together (a migration nothing reads is inert but a command without its tables is
red); S3 can land behind them; S4 gates S6. Two-arm review per D-036 on every SHA-changing
stage.

The brain rolling-window production order is migration, then command and read edge
functions, then the client. The release lead applies it; a source commit does not establish
that the migration or functions are live.

## 12. Open questions for review

1. Should `file_download_url` be per-version or always-current by default? (Spec says
   current unless `--version`; reviewers may prefer explicit-always.)
2. Is 30 days the right restore window, or should it match the signal `--until` cap (30d)
   by rule rather than coincidence?
3. Does the two-phase upload need an explicit abort verb, or is the 3-hour pending sweep
   (★R15: 2h URL validity plus margin) enough?
4. Case-insensitive name uniqueness: right call, or does it fight agents that generate
   `Plan.md` and `plan.md` as distinct artifacts?
