# Resume here — 2026-08-07, end of session

**Verify every SHA by hash.** Braced revisions only: `"${R}:src/..."`, never `"$R:src/..."`.

main   e46f227 (or later — run `git rev-parse --short main`; this file is written at a point in time)
```

**There are no other branches.** 94 remote and 30 local branches were deleted this session, and
37 worktrees removed. That was the largest irreversible act here and it is the first thing a
successor should know, because **the previous resume file's branch table is now entirely dead
refs.** Anything you read elsewhere that says "see branch X" is stale.

## LIVE IN PRODUCTION

| | |
|---|---|
| CLI | **v0.1.8** — `curl -fsSL https://commonswarm.com/install.sh \| sh`, sha256 `101f2ec5…` |
| Supabase pooler | **`pool_size = 38`** on project `ukezjcnxjvkpkeezxaew` — a live config change, not a doc |
| Site | scrollbars hidden, `/download` 0.1.8, corrected privacy/terms copy |
| Edge functions | `read` **v6** (2026-07-31), `command` v16, `capability` v2 |

**The pooler raise is the most live thing this session did.** Raised 15 → 30 → 38. Resting fleet
demand was ~17 against a ceiling of 15, so solitary requests were failing ~42% of the time.
Resting-demand and isolated-burst faults are fixed; sustained-burst is not, and is not fixable by
`pool_size` on Micro (absolute ceiling 41, zero margin). Evidence:
`docs/evidence/2026-08-05-pooler-raise/`.

## MEASURED, NOT INFERRED

The agent → cloud → agent **wake round trip works on production**, on the shipped binary, for
claude and codex, including a **cold** recipient (no listener running: the ask times out, the
message persists, starting the listener wakes the agent with it). Controls: `in_reply_to` bound
to the exact ask, send-time nonce echoed, reply read back under a *different* credential.
`docs/evidence/2026-08-06-agent-wake-round-trip.md`.

`deliveryMode: cursor_fallback` was observed at runtime, which is what makes D-040/041/041a/042
unreachable in production — they need `durable_claim`, and deployed `read` v6 cannot advertise it.

## STRATEGIC DECISION 2026-08-07 — read this before planning anything

**CommonSwarm sits on cross-user and provider-agnostic.** Operator decision, after Anthropic
shipped native inter-agent messaging in Claude Code v2.1.224.
Full reasoning: `docs/org/2026-08-07-POSITIONING-CROSS-USER.md`.

The short version: **run 1 of our wake evidence — claude↔claude, same user, same machine — is
now a free Claude Code built-in.** Runs 2 and 3 (a codex recipient, and a COLD recipient whose
ask persisted server-side) are things their design refuses, because their socket is scoped to one
OS user and an offline session has nothing to queue to.

**The obligation that creates is the top of the list below:** the cross-user round trip has never
been measured. It is in our own evidence file's "Not established" list. Do not change public copy
until it passes.

## NEXT ACTIONS, in order

0. **MEASURE THE CROSS-USER, CROSS-MACHINE ROUND TRIP.** The whole positioning rests on it and it
   is unmeasured. Rig exists: Wren is identity B on `toms-m1-max-mbp`. Doubles as the first real
   exercise of the invite path — §6 item 3, the only OPEN launch-bar item.


1. ~~**The register is behind the work.**~~ **PARTLY DONE 2026-08-08 in `e21f5b4`**, and one
   claim in the original wording was **wrong**:

   - **D-058** — entered. Was cited eight times against a number with no entry.
   - **D-060** — entered. New number.
   - **D-061** — entered. New: a directed signal is invisible to its author.
   - **D-059** — tombstoned, not entered. No content for it survives anywhere in the repo, so
     the allocation cannot be reconstructed; reserved rather than silently reused.
   - ~~"the logout defect family fixed in 0.1.8 has no entry"~~ — **DEAD, this was wrong.** The
     family is **D-043**, filed and marked FIXED in v0.1.8. Measured with a control (`D-043` 2).
     The genuine gap was narrower and elsewhere: the *overclaim* fixed in the same release — the
     CLI reporting a sign-out the server had refused — had no entry, and is now **D-060**.

   **Still open on this item:** D-050 was reproduced twice on 08-06 with no update; D-056 does
   not mention the pooler raise and its 25% cold-start figure was measured at `pool_size = 15`
   with no marker saying so.
2. **The `read` deploy vehicle is still unnamed, and the drift has grown.** Main's
   `supabase/functions/read` is four commits past deployed v6 — an entire durable-delivery
   feature plus three fix rounds. The `signal_deliveries` migration is **already applied on
   production**. So anyone lifting D-047 to ship the one-line `EMAXCONNSESSION` classifier will,
   in the same act, deploy the whole durable-delivery read path, against a `_shared/protocol.js`
   bundle that must be regenerated. The operator's partial freeze lift is recorded only in
   `docs/evidence/2026-08-05-pooler-raise/README.md` §6 — **not in D-047 itself**.
3. **A second clone holds ~48 commits on no remote.**
   `/Users/yulanbot/Developer/Ridge.io/cloud-swarm-source` is a separate full clone with 9
   registered worktrees. Most content landed via other SHAs, but genuinely unlanded work exists —
   including a "5s negative skew for remove_member fresh-auth" fix with zero hits on main. **This
   session's deletions did not orphan it** (those branches were never on GitHub), but "0 unpushed"
   was measured on one clone of two. Needs a disposition: rescue or deliberate discard.

## STILL OWED TO THE OPERATOR

- **No rollback procedure** while `install.sh` serves `latest`. Two releases shipped through it.
- **The dogfood fleet shares the production pool** — 8 seats against 38 connections.
- **`main` is unprotected**; ruleset `swarm-1human-main` is disabled.
- opencode never reaches ready (undiagnosed). grok is out of credits. **claude and codex are the
  working set.**
- **D-050**: `listen stop` reports success while orphaning an adapter child. Reproduced twice.

## STALE DOCS — do not trust these without re-checking

`docs/org/2026-08-06-RESUME-HERE.md` (superseded by this file; its branch table is all dead refs,
and it calls the pooler raise "docs only"), `2026-08-05-LEAD-HANDOFF.md` (issues the pooler raise
as a pending order), `2026-08-06-JUST-WORK-PLAN.md` (lists the logout wedge as blocked),
`2026-08-05-pooler-raise/README.md` (titled "15 → 30", body records 38),
`2026-07-26-simplification-state.md` (names a branch as "do not prune" that was pruned; says the
R1 files are absent from main — they landed in `5f23b6a`), and the design docs pinning frozen
SHAs to the deleted `next/0.1.6-ui-shape`.

## WHAT I GOT WRONG, so it is not repeated

- **I reported "nothing lost" after the prune and was wrong.** D-043 was destroyed and survived
  only in an unreachable commit. My content check asked *which files exist on the branch and not
  on main*; the register was a **modified** file, so the path was present while the content
  inside it was gone. **A content-level path check is not a content-level diff.** Restored in
  `e46f227` after a proper sweep of all 919 unreachable commits.
- **I ran a delete in the same shell invocation as the check that would have stopped it.**
  Thirteen branches showed unique files and were deleted anyway. Nothing else turned out to be
  lost, but that was luck following a bad procedure.
- **The scrollbar CSS was deployed but never merged**, so my own 0.1.8 site deploy silently
  reverted it. "Deployed ≠ landed" in the direction nobody checks. Fixed in `4888799`.
