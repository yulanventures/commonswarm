/**
 * End-to-end gate on the inbox --follow backoff, driven through the real CLI
 * against a loopback stub. Pure: no external network, no database.
 *
 * ★ Reached by `npm run test:p1-cli` via the tests/p1-cli/**\/*.test.ts glob.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN ONLY THE UNIT TESTS. D-055 shipped a defect that
 * every unit test missed: the terminal frame was emitted by a helper the tests
 * called directly, while the CLI path forgot to call it. A test that passes
 * against the wrong target is not a test. This one spawns the CLI and reads its
 * stdout, so the thing under test is the thing users run.
 *
 * It also gives D-051 companion 1 (backoff decay) its only non-unit evidence.
 * Wren established it is UNMEASURABLE in production: the decay counter only
 * advances on a RETRYABLE failure, and every current production failure is
 * refused, so the veto fires first and the counter is never touched. The stub
 * below serves the retryable failure mode production is not currently
 * producing.
