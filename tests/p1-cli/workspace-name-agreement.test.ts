/**
 * Item D: agents and humans must call a workspace by the same name.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The operator asked whether to add Grok Bot to "the CommonSwarm Build
 * workspace" and CSwarmStrategist could not answer, because no agent surface returned the
 * workspace's display name — `whoami --json` gave `workspace_id` and `owner_display_name` and
 * nothing else. A person names a workspace; an agent names a uuid; neither can check the other.
 *
 * The failure this pins is DRIFT: the CLI and the app reading the workspace name from different
 * places, or rendering it in different shapes, so the same id gets two names. So the controls
 * here are about AGREEMENT, not about either value on its own.
 *
 * Reached by `npm test` (named in the literal list) and `npm run test:p1-cli` (glob).
