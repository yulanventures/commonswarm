/**
 * The chat client: what it puts on the wire, what it refuses before it sends
 * anything, and what it says afterwards.
 *
 * Three claims are gated here.
 *
 * 1. **The client's copy of the channel rules cannot drift from the edge's.**
 *    `src/cloud/channels.ts` duplicates the constants in
 *    `supabase/functions/_shared/channels.ts` because `tsconfig.json` pins
 *    `rootDir` to `src` and a module under `src/` cannot import one under
 *    `supabase/`. That duplication is the exact failure AGENTS.md measured four
 *    times in one release cycle, so this file imports BOTH and compares them.
 *    Its bound: it compares the constants and the generated sentences NAMED
 *    below, generated from `sharedConstantNames`, and it compares
 *    `channelSlugProblem` over the cases in `slugCases`, which are themselves
 *    derived from the shared constants rather than typed. It does NOT prove the
 *    two modules export the same SET of names, and it does not reach the
 *    database CHECK — `tests/chat-channel-constants.test.ts` owns that pairing.
 *
 * 2. **The bodies match what the served edge accepts.** The expected shapes are
 *    the ones `tests/p1-server/chat-signals.test.ts` sends against a real
 *    command function: its `installedPost()` helper is reproduced here as
 *    `installedPostBody`, and its channel commands as `channelCommandCases`.
 *    That test proves the shapes are accepted; this one proves the client emits
 *    them, without a database.
 *
 * 3. **A name that cannot be a channel name is refused before the credential is
 *    read, and never over the network.** Spawned against `dist/cli.js` with a
 *    complete target and a credential path that cannot exist, so a probe that
 *    got past the local check says `agent_token_file_unreadable` and one that
 *    reached the network would say something else again. Nothing here connects.
 *
 * Gate: `npm run test:p1-cli` (a glob over tests/p1-cli/**), which is also
 * reached by `npm run check:tests`.
