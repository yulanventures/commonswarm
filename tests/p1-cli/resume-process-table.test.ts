/**
 * `cswarm resume` reads the host process table, and a process's whole argv is
 * in that output. Agents that pass a large prompt as a command-line argument
 * put the whole prompt there: measured on the shared mini on 2026-09-04, the
 * two longest command lines were 72,069 and 72,066 characters, both review-arm
 * invocations. The shipped reader called `ps` through a fixed 4 MB stdout
 * buffer, so on a busy host `resume` died with "stdout maxBuffer length
 * exceeded" — the first command an agent is told to run after a restart, and
 * the one that tells its orphan watchers apart from a teammate's.
 *
 * These controls drive the real `systemProcessTable` against a fake `ps`, so
 * they exercise the streaming reader rather than a fake of it.
 *
 * Reached by BOTH package.json's literal `npm test` list and
 * `npm run test:p1-cli` through tests/p1-cli/**\/*.test.ts.
