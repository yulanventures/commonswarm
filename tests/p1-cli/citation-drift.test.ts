/**
 * Every file:line this lane's comments cite must still point at what they claim.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A review arm found that the standing-grant follow-up carried citations that
 * were correct when they were written — verified line by line against origin/main @ e3df06b —
 * and wrong by the time they landed, because the lane they were rebuilt on top of
 * (20260904000001_standing_grant_resume + its command-function changes) inserted ~275 lines
 * into supabase/functions/command/index.ts and pushed every later line down. Nothing about the
 * claims was wrong. The NUMBERS were, and only a human re-reading each one could tell.
 *
 * AGENTS.md already says "measure the artifact, not its name" and "an enumeration inside a
 * message must be generated, not typed". A line number is the same shape of defect: a hand-typed
 * pointer with no control on it, which drifts the moment anything above it moves, and which the
 * next reader trusts because it looks precise.
 *
 * So each entry below is a citation some comment makes, plus the token that must appear at that
 * line. When a citation drifts, this test names it. It does NOT check that the comment's
 * REASONING is right — only that the pointer still resolves. Read the prose yourself.
 *
 * Reached by `npm test` (named in the literal list) and by `npm run test:p1-cli` (glob).
