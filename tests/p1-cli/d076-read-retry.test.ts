/* D-076. `postgres@3.4.9` crashes the read isolate outside the handler's promise catch — a
 * `nextWrite` firing after `closed()` has nulled the socket — and the platform answers 503.
 * Measured by Plumb against production: 8 crashes in a day, 8/8 joining a `POST 503 /read`.
 * Upstream PR #1168 adds the null guard and is still OPEN, so there is no version to upgrade to.
 *
 * A retry works here for a specific reason: it reaches a FRESH ISOLATE. That is not true of
 * server errors in general, which is why the scope below is narrow and each boundary is tested.
 *
 * The measured user-visible symptom was `member read could not reach the cloud service` at
 * roughly 1 in 12 — this exact function. */
