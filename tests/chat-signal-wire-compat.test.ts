/**
 * The wire gate for the chat migration, the twin of receipt-wire-compat.
 *
 * There is no version negotiation on this wire and the server migrates
 * independently of the installed base, so a request shape that every shipped
 * client sends must keep validating after the edge deploys. The measured trap
 * is NOT the schema: it is `exactKeys`. `modernKeys` is an all-or-nothing pair
 * (`to_agent_principal_id` + `in_reply_to`) that every installed writer always
 * sends, and agent READ bodies always send `in_reply_to`. Folding a new
 * optional key into that group makes `exactKeys` demand the new key from every
 * body, returning 400 on every post and every agent read after a perfectly
 * ordered migration, with the schema healthy.
 *
 * Gate: `npm test` (a literal file list — this path is named in package.json).

   * request refused, because there is still no thread to broadcast from.
   * Fixing the broadcast leaves a refusal the caller can then act on. Shape
   * before meaning exists to stop a rule being quoted about a field the caller
   * does not yet have -- the broadcast rule reads thread_root_id and
   * broadcast_to_channel, and says nothing about `to`.
