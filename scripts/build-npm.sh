#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: sandboxed agent environments (Claude Cowork and similar) allow egress
# to package registries but block arbitrary hosts, so `curl | sh` from commonswarm.com
# never arrives. `npm install -g commonswarm` is the same artifact through a door those
# environments leave open. The npm package ships the IDENTICAL bundle build-release.sh
# produced — one file, no dependencies — so the two install paths cannot drift.
#
# The bundle is staged as cswarm.cjs (not extensionless, not .js): it is CJS, and an
# ambient "type": "module" in a parent package.json must not be able to change how Node
# parses it. That exact misread cost a debugging round on 2026-08-17.
