# SCOPE, stated honestly because overstating it would be the defect: this is an ACCIDENT GUARD.
# A workflow living in the repo cannot police identity against a hostile change — GitHub runs the
# workflow that ships WITH the ref under test, so anything it reads can be supplied by the thing
# it is checking. It catches the class that actually happened: an agent picking up an address out
# of a session-context field and committing under it. It does not stop someone who means to.
#
# It is a CI job and not a git hook on purpose. Every offending push in the incident used
# --no-verify under a standing ruling that permits it, so a hook would have caught none of them.
#
# The allowlist is DERIVED BY MEASUREMENT, never written from memory. Enumerate first:
#     git log <ref> --format='%ae%n%ce' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
# Writing it from memory is how noreply@github.com — the committer on every squash merge — gets
# omitted and CI fails on main forever.

COMMIT IDENTITY NOT ON THE ALLOWLIST.

If this is your address and it is legitimate, add it to ALLOWED in
scripts/check-commit-identity.sh in the same PR, and say in the commit message why.

If you did NOT choose this address, that is the defect this guard exists for: an agent seat can
pick an address out of a session-context field and commit under it. Do not pass -c user.email at
all; state the identity explicitly. Fix with:

    git -c user.email=<correct> commit --amend --reset-author     # last commit
    git rebase -r --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit --reset-author' <base>   # several

This guard is accident-scope. It cannot stop a deliberate change, because GitHub runs the
workflow that ships with the ref under test.
