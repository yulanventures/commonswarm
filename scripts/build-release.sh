# The artifact name must match what install.sh downloads (`$BASE/cswarm` and
# `$BASE/cswarm.sha256`). If you rename it here, rename it there in the same change.
#
# WHY A BUNDLE AND NOT A TARBALL OF dist/: the CLI has runtime dependencies
# (@supabase/supabase-js, postgres) and `dist/` alone is not runnable — it needs a
# node_modules beside it. Bundling makes the artifact ONE FILE with no install step
# and no dependency resolution on the user's machine, which is the whole point of a
# `curl | sh` installer.
#
# NODE IS STILL REQUIRED (>=22, see package.json engines). This ships JavaScript, not a
# native executable. The installer checks for it and says so; that is deliberate — a
# fake "self-contained binary" that dies on `node: command not found` is worse UX than
# an installer that names the requirement up front.
