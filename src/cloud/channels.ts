/**
 * Channels, on the client side: the naming rule, the list, and the sentences

 *
 * ## Why the constants below are a COPY, and what keeps the copy honest
 *
 * The enforcement lives in `supabase/functions/_shared/channels.ts`. This file
 * cannot import it. `tsconfig.json` sets `rootDir: "src"`, so a module under
 * `src/` that reaches into `supabase/` fails the build with TS6059 before any
 * of it runs; the edge module is also read by `deno check`, which resolves
 * `.ts` specifiers, while `tsc` under Node16 resolves `.js` ones, so one file
 * cannot satisfy both from here. The protocol bundle would be the shared home,
 * but `src/protocol/` is owned by the schema lane and exports none of this.
 *
 * So the values are duplicated ON PURPOSE, once, in this comment's sight:
 * `tests/p1-cli/chat-cli.test.ts` imports BOTH modules and fails when any
 * constant, any generated sentence, or any `channelSlugProblem` answer differs.
 * The test is what makes the copy safe; without it this file would be exactly
 * the typed-enumeration failure AGENTS.md measured four times in one release.
 *
 * Every user-facing sentence here is BUILT from the constant the validator
 * reads, never typed, for the same reason.

 *
 * Their measured cause was accurate when written and is no longer true:
 * `parseBody` in `supabase/functions/read/index.ts` had no channels arm. It has
 * one, `listChannelsAsAgent` below reads it, and `channelRows` in src/cli.ts no
 * longer REFUSES an agent credential, so an agent lists channels and turns a
 * name into an id exactly as a person does.
 *
 * CORRECTED: an earlier draft of this note, and the commit message that landed
 * it, said `channelRows` "no longer branches on the credential kind". It still
 * does, and it has to: the read function accepts agent credentials only and a
 * person reads swarm_read over PostgREST, so the kind picks the transport. What
 * it no longer does is throw before reading anything.
 *
 * ⚠ THE COUPLING THIS CREATES. A client carrying these removals talks to a read
 * service that may not have the arm yet. Against such a deployment
