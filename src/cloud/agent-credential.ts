/*
 * Where a renewed agent credential lives between CLI invocations.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. An agent credential arrives on stdin and, until now, died
 * with the process. That is fine for a one-hour token and fatal for the thing the product
 * is actually for: a work session that runs for days or weeks. §2.3 answers it with a
 * fenced successor operation rather than a longer token, which only works if the successor
 * outlives the invocation that obtained it — so it has to be written down somewhere.
 *
 * THE PREDECESSOR IS NEVER WRITTEN HERE. Only the live successor is, under the same
 * discipline §2.3 requires of the CLI's own credential storage: a 0600 file inside a 0700
 * directory owned by the current user, atomically replaced, never an env var and never a
 * log line. `swm_agt_` material appears in exactly one field of one record and in no
 * message, no Error, and no filename.
 *
 * THE FILENAME IS A LINEAGE KEY, NOT A CREDENTIAL. The record has to be found again next
 * invocation, when all the process has is the same (by then expired) stdin credential. So
 * the file is named by sha256 of that root credential, truncated — the same one-way
 * derivation the server stores as token_hash. It reverses to nothing, and it means a
 * second agent handed a different credential on the same machine gets a different record
 * rather than silently adopting somebody else's successor.
