 * Measured: 8 crashes in a day, 8/8 joining a `POST 503 /read`. Upstream PR #1168 fixes it and is
 * still open, so there is no version to upgrade to. A retry reaches a FRESH ISOLATE, which is why
 * it works here and would not for an ordinary server error.
 *
 * Scoped deliberately:
 * - **Reads only.** Every caller of `fetchSignalRead` is a read, so repeating cannot duplicate a
 *   signal. A write must never get this treatment without idempotency keys.
 * - **5xx only.** A 4xx says the request is wrong; repeating it cannot help.
 * - **The server's veto wins.** D-051: `retryable: false` governs exactly this — an immediate
 *   retry of the same request — so it is honoured before the status.
 * - **Timeouts propagate.** They are already bounded by the caller's deadline, and retrying one
 *   would spend that deadline twice.
 * - **A caller's abort wins.** Checked before sleeping, so cancellation stays prompt.
 * - **One-shot reads only.** `agentSignalPage` is shared with `readAgentSignalPage`, which
 *   the follow loop drives, and that loop ALREADY retries with earned backoff (D-051,
 *   D-056). Wrapping it here put a second retry underneath a working one and silently
 *   absorbed the failures the outer loop counts — two D-051 gates caught it. The same
 *   mistake D-063 was filed for. So this applies to `humanSignals` and
 *   `readAgentSignalDirectory`, which have no retry above them and are where the measured
 *   member-read failure lives.

/**
 * How long a follow loop keeps absorbing server refusals within one burst.
 *
 * D-056. The veto from D-051 is correct and stays: a refusal must block an
 * IMMEDIATE retry, because retrying into pooler exhaustion amplifies the very
 * condition that caused it. What the veto cannot see is that the server's
 * `retryable:false` is sometimes WRONG. Measured: pooler exhaustion reaches
 * `read` as a generic `XX000`, `XX000` is not in that function's
 * `RETRYABLE_CODES`, so a transient busy spell is reported as permanent. The
 * fault clears on its own within minutes.
 *
 * Honouring a false permanent refusal kills an unsupervised receiver on its
 * first burst, silently, with nothing to restart it — `cswarm inbox --follow`
 * has no supervisor. So the refusal is honoured as "do not retry NOW" rather
 * than "never retry": each tolerated refusal waits the full jittered backoff
 * before the next attempt.
 *
 * ~~"...which is the opposite of amplification."~~ DEAD (Plumb, 2026-08-05):
 * that was false. It is bounded, rate-limited amplification — fewer requests
 * than the fielded 0.1.6's unbounded retry, but more than zero, and they land
 * on the saturated service. Say bounded, not absent.
 *
 * And this IS a bounded override of the veto, not merely a block on immediate
 * retry. Ordinary retries were already delayed, so "it only blocks an IMMEDIATE
 * retry" distinguishes nothing and overstates what is preserved: a
 * `retryable:false` now buys the same delayed rearm that other retries get, via
 * a second branch. The honest statement is that the refusal is overridden, on a
 * bounded budget, because the server's verdict is measurably wrong for this
 * fault.
 *
 * This is a WORKAROUND for a server-side misclassification, not a design
 * choice. The correct fix classifies the pooler's exhaustion as retryable at
 * source; that change is a `read` deploy and is gated separately. When it
 * lands, this tolerance becomes redundant rather than wrong.
 *
 * Bounded, not unbounded: the fielded 0.1.6 retries forever, which is the
 * other failure this replaces. Exhausting the budget still produces the
 * terminal frame with `server_refused: true` and exit 75, so a supervisor that
 * does exist keeps its restart signal.
 *
 * WHY TIME AND NOT A COUNT. A count cannot express the intent. Measured by
 * Verity against the first version of this: a budget of 3 buys 1.75-3.5s,
 * because the tolerated attempts share the backoff ladder and the first three
 * rungs are 250/500/1000ms. Against a fault window whose measured upper bound
 * is ~420s that is under 1%, so the receiver died anyway and the fix only
 * looked like one. The budget is therefore the WINDOW to survive, and the
 * existing 30s backoff cap bounds the request count that falls out of it:
 * at most 9 attempts across 60s (that is the worst case at random()=0; ~6 is
 * typical mid-jitter). The 30s backoff cap is irrelevant at this budget — it
 * saves ONE request, because the ladder only reaches 30s at attempt 7 and the
 * window closes at 8-9. The cap only starts to matter if the budget is ever
 * raised past ~120s, which is the trigger to revisit it.
 *
 * 60s DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER THE WHOLE OBSERVED FAULT. The measured upper
 * bound for a pooler burst is ~420s, and a budget that long means a receiver
 * sits silent for seven minutes, which is its own bad outcome. So this covers
 * SHORT spells in process. State the longer case as what is IMPLEMENTED rather
 * than as what it enables (Plumb): a spell outlasting the window ends the
 * session with the terminal frame and exit 75, and IT STAYS ENDED unless an
 * external supervisor or a person restarts it. Nothing shipped consumes exit
 * 75 today -- it marks the stop as restartable, it does not restart anything.
 * Do not let a release note imply it survives the full window.
 *
 * That rate is the honest comparison, and it is against the FIELDED
 * alternative rather than against silence: 0.1.6 retries this same fault
 * unbounded, at a measured 13.2 frames/min. Simulated against the real ladder
 * (Plumb): this emits 7-9 retry frames before the window closes — roughly
 * 53-68% of the fielded rate, not the "quarter" an earlier version of this
 * comment claimed. Less load than what is in production today, and materially
 * more than zero; the thing it replaces is a receiver that dies and never
 * comes back.
 *
 * NOT A HARD 60s CEILING, and the wording matters (Plumb): the elapsed check
 * runs BEFORE the sleep, so the loop stops at the first refusal observed AFTER
 * the window closes. Simulated stop times are 60.7s / 68.6s / 61.5s across the
 * jitter range, plus request latency. Read it as "keep retrying until a refusal
 * lands past 60s", not "stop at exactly 60s".
 *
 * PER BURST, NOT PER LIFETIME. The window resets on any successful read, for
 * the same reason `attempt` decays there. A lifetime budget killed a healthy
 * long-lived receiver that met a handful of ISOLATED refusals hours apart,
 * with a success between each -- nothing about that is a burst. Every test
 * used consecutive refusals, so nothing could tell the two apart.
 *
 * The 420s figure is an UPPER BOUND from one observation with load ceasing,
 * not a validated value, and the 60s default deliberately does NOT cover it —
 * see the split above. The 10-minute ceiling sits above the observed fault so
 * an operator can choose to cover it, and below forever so a typo cannot.

 * path. It also happens to make the value injectable, which is what lets a test
 * exercise the budget without sleeping it.
 *
 * NEVER SILENT WHEN IT DISAGREES WITH YOU. Both review arms independently
 * arrived at this, from opposite directions, and it is the part that matters:
 *
 *   - Plumb: `CSWARM_REFUSAL_TOLERANCE_MS=O` (letter O, the likeliest typo for
 *     an intended strict `0`) resolved to the DEFAULT, so a host asking for no
 *     tolerance silently got 60s of it. Fail-open on the knob's own purpose.
 *   - Verity: a value above the ceiling was clamped without a word, so the knob
 *     quietly disagreed with the operator.
 *
 * They proposed opposite fallbacks for malformed input — 0 vs the default —
 * and the tie breaks on which mistake is worse. Malformed -> 0 means someone
 * fat-fingering a LARGE value gets the strict veto and their receivers die on
 * the first refusal, which is precisely the D-056 failure this exists to
 * prevent. Malformed -> default means someone fat-fingering `0` gets a little
 * more retry load than they wanted. So the default stays, and the warning is
 * what makes it honest: the operator is told, rather than the code guessing
 * silently in either direction.
 *
 * Unset or empty is NOT a mistake — no intent was expressed — so it takes the
 * default without comment. Negative clamps to 0: the sign is likelier a typo
 * than an intent to remove the bound. The upper clamp exists because
 * `600000000` would otherwise buy a ~7-day budget, i.e. the unbounded retry of
 * 0.1.6 that this change exists to REPLACE, re-created by accident through the
 * knob added to prevent it.
