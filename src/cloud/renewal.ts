/*
 * Silent worker-token renewal (SWARM-CLOUD.md §2.3, "Worker-token renewal is a fenced
 * SUCCESSOR operation, not a mint").
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES, AND THE FIX IT REFUSES TO MAKE. An agent work session now runs
 * for days or weeks. An agent token lives one hour by default and eight hours at the
 * absolute most, and until this file existed there was no renewal path at all — the eight
 * hours were a wall, not a ceiling, and a person had to re-mint by hand. The tempting fix
 * is a longer TTL. A month-long bearer token sitting on a developer machine is precisely
 * the trade §2.3 was written to refuse, so the TTL numbers here are UNCHANGED (1h default,
 * 8h maximum) and this file makes renewal happen so often that nobody notices it.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT SAFE, restated so a future edit cannot quietly drop one:
 *
 *   - The command object carries NO TARGET FIELDS — it is `{ kind }` and nothing else. Not
 *     principal, not run, not task, not epoch, not scopes, not a TTL. renewalCommand() is
 *     the only place it is built and it is asserted to hold exactly one key, because "we
 *     simply never send that field" is a convention and an assertion is a mechanism. The
 *     command function refuses any other key at the wire (validateCommand's exactKeys
 *     check) before authorization runs, so both sides hold the same line.
 *   - The server derives principal, run, task, epoch and scopes from the predecessor row it
 *     authenticated. Nothing this file sends can point renewal at another run.
 *   - Attenuation is the server's job, measured against the PREDECESSOR. This file never
 *     asks for a scope, so it cannot ask for a broader one.
 *   - The client refuses a successor whose lifetime exceeds AGENT_TOKEN_MAX_TTL_MS. A
 *     deployment answering "here, have thirty days" is the failure mode this whole design
 *     exists to prevent, and it should be refused on both sides of the wire.
 *
 * ★ NOT RENEWING TWICE. src/cloud/pending-command.ts records what a blind retry cost once:
 * a 5xx answered AFTER the mint transaction committed, the retry generated a fresh command
 * id, missed the idempotency ledger, and issued a SECOND live credential. Renewal has the
 * same shape and two more racers — concurrent requests inside one process, and two CLI
 * invocations sharing a lineage on one machine. All three are closed here:
 *
 *   in-process   one shared promise; a second caller awaits the first renewal.
 *   cross-process  the lineage's file lock is held across read-decide-write.
 *   ambiguity    the command id is PERSISTED before the request and kept on a 5xx or a
 *                transport failure, so the next attempt is a replay and not a second mint.
 *
 * WHEN RENEWAL FAILS, a one-shot command may use its still-live predecessor
 * after an unknown outcome, but a 401/403 refusal uses the D-004/D-011 fatal
 * message. The listener retries unknown outcomes with capped backoff and
 * treats a recognized authentication answer as a confirmation-window sample.
