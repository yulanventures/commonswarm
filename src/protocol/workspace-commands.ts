       *
       * Superseding a predecessor is implemented as setting expires_at = now, so a
       * superseded token IS an expired token and the expiry branch would always answer
       * first. That made 'predecessor_superseded' unreachable — a named reason that could
       * never fire, which reads as a distinction the system draws and does not.
       *
       * (Supersession now happens at the successor's FIRST USE rather than at issue, so
       * the two are no longer simultaneous — but the ordering still matters, because by
       * the time a second renewal is attempted the successor has usually been used and the
       * predecessor has therefore been ended. Nothing below relies on the old timing.)
       *
       * It matters beyond tidiness because these two say opposite things to whoever is
       * holding the credential. 'expired' means time passed and you should have renewed
       * sooner. 'superseded' means A SUCCESSOR ALREADY EXISTS — you renewed twice, or you
       * lost a concurrency race, and there is a live credential you should be using instead.
       * Told the wrong one, an agent retries the renewal that just lost and loses again.
       *
       * Measured: the concurrent-double-renewal test had exactly one winner (correct) while
       * the loser was told 'predecessor_expired' (misleading), which is how this surfaced.
       *
       * ★ `&& !facts.successor_pending` IS THE SELF-HEALING CLAUSE, NOT A LOOSENING.
       * A successor that has never authenticated reached nobody: the only copy of its raw
       * credential was in a response body, and if the presenter is back here asking again
       * then that body did not arrive. Refusing it 'predecessor_superseded' is what stranded
       * the worker permanently — a live successor nobody can reach, and a human
       * reauthorisation caused by a dropped connection. So a PENDING successor falls through
       * to be discarded and replaced by the adapter (which revokes it, recording that it was
       * stranded), while a USED successor still refuses here: that agent HAS a working

       * backfill it, so at the moment it applies EVERY token in the field is pending. Had
       * this check stayed at the top, the first renewal of every live agent — including

       * Between issue and first use a successor and its predecessor are both live. That
       * overlap is the price of recoverability — it is what lets a renewal whose response

       * predecessor's remaining TTL (<= 1h). It must not be EXTENDABLE: if a token that
       * had never been used could itself issue a successor, an agent could chain unused
       * tokens and hold an ever-growing set of live credentials, none of which was ever
       * proven to have reached anybody.
       *
       * `predecessor_pending` is read BEFORE this request's own first-use stamp, which is
       * what makes the check mean something: authenticating to renew is itself a use, so
       * measured after the stamp no token is ever pending and the rule would be vacuous.
       *
       * Consequence worth stating plainly: an agent whose very first act with a fresh
       * successor is another renewal is refused exactly once. The refused request still
