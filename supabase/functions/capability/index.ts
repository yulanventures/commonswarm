/**
 * The anonymous capability-URL read (§7 "Zero-install first touch"), kept in its
 * own edge function because §7's allowlist rule requires everything off the list
 * to be *unreachable*, not merely un-selected.
 *
 * `functions/read/index.ts` authenticates a swm_agt_ credential and then
 * deliberately widens itself — it sets request.jwt.claims, switches to the
 * broader member-read role, and queries the exposed read views for the message
 * stream and the roster-with-attribution that §7 forbids a capability URL from
 * ever serving. An anonymous branch inside that file would be one mis-ordered
 * early-return away from serving them. This function instead runs as
 * SET LOCAL ROLE swarm_capability, which holds EXECUTE on one projection
 * function, and SELECT on no table carrying tenant data: the field allowlist is
 * enforced by
 * PostgreSQL, not by this file's discipline.
 *
 * Do not add a capability branch to `functions/read/index.ts`, and do not grant
 * swarm_capability (or anon) anything in the member-read schema.
 *
 * The forbidden-identifier grep §7 asks for is part of this file's contract: a
 * search here for the roster, message-stream, membership, delivery-queue or
 * member-read-view identifiers, or for any streaming/subscription API, must
 * return zero. It answers one request with one JSON object and closes.

 *
 * It used to be one bucket_key. Its INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE takes a
 * row-exclusive lock on that single row and holds it until the transaction
 * commits — and this transaction also runs the projection query and an audit
 * INSERT. So EVERY concurrent request on the only anonymous, internet-reachable
 * surface in the product queued behind one row, for the whole request, and the
 * queue was longest during exactly the surge this counter exists to observe.
 * A counter that never refuses had become a hard throughput ceiling, and worse,
 * a lock-contention amplifier available to any stranger: 5s lock_timeout, then
 * failures on a path whose stated design is "this one never refuses".
 *
 * Writes now land on one of GLOBAL_SHARDS rows chosen at random, so contention
 * falls by that factor. Math.random is right here: nothing is being kept secret,
 * the only requirement is even spread, and a hash-derived shard would pin one
 * caller to one row and re-create a hot spot per attacker.
 *
 * ★ WHAT THE SHARDING COSTS, CORRECTED 2026-07-28. The superseded sentence —
 * *"The SIGNAL IS NOT WEAKENED … the alert still fires on the true global count
 * crossing GLOBAL_READ_LIMIT, and still exactly once per window"* — is **dead**:
 * it overstated by one word, "still", and this repo ranks a comment asserting
 * what the control flow does not do above a bug. What holds exactly:
 *
 *   - AT MOST ONE alert per window. GLOBAL_ALERT_LATCH_KEY is inserted ON
 *     CONFLICT DO NOTHING, so only the transaction that created the latch row
 *     alerts.
 *   - It never fires below the limit: the sum of the shard rows really did cross
 *     GLOBAL_READ_LIMIT, and it is read — not locked — so the ordinary path
 *     never pays for it.
 *
 * What does NOT hold is "on the crossing":
 *
 *   - The aggregate runs only when THIS request's shard is already past its own
 *     share, so the request that takes the true total past the limit triggers
 *     nothing if it landed on a light shard. Pigeonhole says some shard is at or
 *     past GLOBAL_SHARD_SHARE whenever the total is over (16 × 1249 = 19984 <
 *     20001), so the alert lands on the next request that hits such a shard —
 *     in a real surge, within a handful of requests. If traffic stops dead at
 *     the crossing, the window can end with no alert at all.
 *   - The sum is of COMMITTED shard rows at READ COMMITTED, so it lags whatever
 *     concurrent transactions have incremented but not yet committed.
 *
 * For a surge alarm on a 20000/hour threshold that lag is the intended trade.
 * It is a prompt alert on a true crossing, not an exact one.

    /* ★ REFUSALS AUDIT ONCE PER CALLER PER WINDOW, NOT ONCE PER REQUEST.
     *
     * swarm.audit_log is append-only — a trigger blocks DELETE — and unlike
     * idempotency_keys and rate_buckets it has NO purge schedule. So on the only
     * anonymous, internet-reachable surface in the product, a row per rejected request
     * was permanent, unbounded growth that any stranger could drive: roughly 1-2 GB a
     * day at 1k rps, filling the volume, taking the command function down with it, and
     * burying every real security signal underneath.
     *
     * The refusal is still recorded — the FIRST one from a caller in each window, which
     * is what an investigator actually needs — and the flood after it is already
     * counted, because rate_buckets holds the exact request count for that key.
     *
     * The RESPONSE is unchanged and unconditional, so the uniform-failure rule is
     * untouched: invalid, expired, revoked and never-existed remain indistinguishable.
     * Only the server-side write is throttled, and a caller cannot observe it. */
    /* ★ THE HARD BOUND. Every per-caller key on this request is forgeable, so throttling
     * per key cannot bound anything — an attacker just picks a new key. This budget is
     * keyed on a CONSTANT, so the number of permanent audit rows an unauthenticated
     * population can create in a window is capped outright, whatever they send.
     *
     * It is deliberately generous: real refusals are rare, so REFUSAL_AUDIT_BUDGET is far
     * above honest traffic and only bites under the flood it exists to survive. Losing
     * refusal rows past the cap is the correct trade — the alert still fires, and
     * rate_buckets still holds exact counts, so nothing that matters for investigation is
     * lost. An audit log that fills the volume protects nobody.

     * The response is unchanged and unconditional either way, so the uniform-failure rule
     * is untouched and no caller can observe whether their refusal was recorded. */
