/**
 * Resolves the presented agent credential AND records that it has been used, in
 * every edge function that authenticates one — §2.3 first-use supersession.
 *
 * ★ THE STAMP LIVES HERE, NOT IN THE COMMAND FUNCTION, AND THAT PLACEMENT IS THE
 * WHOLE CORRECTNESS ARGUMENT. `first_used_at IS NULL` ("PENDING") is what makes a
 * successor DISPOSABLE: a renewal that finds a pending successor revokes it and
 * issues a fresh one, on the reasoning that a token nobody has ever used is a
 * token nobody received. That reasoning is only sound if EVERY authentication
 * path stamps. An earlier version stamped only in the command function, so an
 * agent doing what agents actually do between commands — polling `read` for
 * signals — authenticated successfully over and over while its credential stayed
 * PENDING for ever. Any later renewal from the still-live predecessor would then
 * revoke a credential that was in active use, permanently and with a tombstone,
 * and the agent's next command would 401 with no reason naming the discard.
 * "Pending" has to mean "unused", and `read` is a use.
 *
 * TWO STATEMENTS, NOT ONE, AND NOT AN ACCIDENT. The stamping UPDATE takes a row
 * lock, so a concurrent discard of the same token makes this block. Under READ
 * COMMITTED a statement's snapshot is taken before it waits: the UPDATE
 * re-evaluates the row after the lock clears (so it correctly declines to stamp a
 * token revoked while we waited), but any SELECT in the SAME statement would
 * still report that row as it looked BEFORE the wait — i.e. not revoked. Folded
 * into one statement, this function would hand back a credential whose revocation
 * had already committed. The liveness read is therefore its own statement, taken
 * on a fresh snapshot after the lock is released. It costs one round trip on the
 * agent auth path and it is the difference between reading state and reading the
 * past.
