/**
 * Server half of workspace file artifacts (S2).
 * Spec: docs/design/2026-08-18-FILE-ARTIFACTS.md — the ★R pins named below are
 * load-bearing review findings; do not remove one without reopening the review.
 *
 * These handlers run beside the reducer (durable-delivery.ts precedent). ★R9:
 * bypassing the reducer means the routed pipeline in index.ts plus this module
 * must re-implement, and here does re-implement, all six protections:
 *   1. revocation on every command      — index.ts `revoked()` on the shared path;
 *   2. written agent classification     — all five kinds are agent-allowed
 *      (FILE_COMMAND_KINDS is exempted from the per-scope gate the way delivery
 *      commands are, because existing minted tokens cannot carry new scopes);
 *      tombstone/restore additionally carry the §6 actor rule in their SQL;
 *   3. an audit row per command         — index.ts audits accept and refuse;
 *   4. command-id idempotency (★R16)    — the shared idempotency_keys insert;
 *   5. tenancy via the compound key (★R1) — every statement here resolves
 *      (workspace_id, file_id), never file_id alone;
 *   6. rate limits (§4)                 — index.ts charges the file bucket
 *      before dispatching file_version_create.
 *
 * File bytes never travel through this function: upload is a signed PUT direct
 * to storage, download is a signed GET (two-phase, §7).

// enforced by Storage at upload time. Commit refuses an object larger than declared
// (file_size_exceeds_declaration); an object smaller than its declaration is accepted
