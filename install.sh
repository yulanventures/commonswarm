# Releases live beside their source, on the public repo. The old default was
# the retired product's separate distribution repo — it NEVER EXISTED, so
# this installer 404'd for every stranger who ran it. The separate -dist repo was specified
# back when source was going to stay private; source is public now, so the reason is gone.
#
# Repointed from the original repo to the public source repo on 2026-08-10. That was NOT a
# rename: cloud-swarm's history carried two operator work addresses in commit metadata, and a
# force-push cannot purge them because GitHub keeps unreachable objects fetchable by SHA. A new
# repo never receives them.
#
# ORDERING, because it is not obvious and it 404s every install if you get it wrong: site's
# `sync:installer` copies THIS FILE into site/public/ on EVERY build, so changing the line below
# ships on the next site deploy whether or not that deploy was about the installer. It was
# changed only after commonswarm was public and serving all 14 releases, and after a real
# install from it was verified with CSWARM_REPO= as an override.

# A bare `command -v node` is correct but its ADVICE is wrong for a large share of users.
# Version managers (nvm, fnm, asdf) put node on PATH from a shell init file, so node is
# invisible to any non-login, non-interactive shell -- ssh, CI, docker exec, a GUI-spawned
# process. Telling someone who already runs v22 under nvm to "brew install node" is a false
# statement on the very first thing they see. So we say WHERE we looked, and name the case.

# --- What to do next. --------------------------------------------------------
# Two kinds of people reach this line and only one of them was invited. An earlier draft
# said only "accept your invite", which is a dead end for anyone who arrived cold.
#
# WITH a link: `accept` is the only first-contact verb that needs no --url, because the
# link carries its own target. Sending someone to `login` would send them looking for a
# project URL that has no page to come from.
#
# WITHOUT one: sign them up. This used to read "invite-only today; creating your own
# workspace is not open yet", which was correct for exactly as long as SWARM_SELF_SERVE was
# unset in production -- create_workspace sits behind that flag in the edge function. It was
# turned on 2026-07-28, and NOTHING IN THIS FILE CHANGES WHEN THAT HAPPENS, so the installer
# went on telling every new user they could not have the thing they could now have. If the
# flag is ever turned off again, `cswarm new` prints "not open on this deployment yet" and
# this paragraph has to come back with it.
# The mechanism here was WRONG until 2026-08-04 and it broke the primary onboarding path.
# It said "cswarm accept --link-stdin" then "Paste the link when prompted". There is no
# prompt: --link-stdin reads stdin and REFUSES a TTY ("--link-stdin requires an invite link
# to be piped on stdin"), so paste-then-Ctrl-D does not work either. A stranger holding an
# invite link and following this text was stopped at the first instruction. Found by a
# second-machine dogfood on production, not by any test -- nothing here is executed by a gate.
# The stated REASON was always right and is kept; only the method was fiction. Piping is also
# what README.md documents.
printf '\nNext, if you have an invite link:\n\n'
# `-rs`, not `-r`: `-s` keeps the link off the screen and out of scrollback. Without it this
# text was telling a stranger to echo a live capability to their terminal on the line directly
# above the sentence explaining why we keep capabilities out of shell history -- the reason was
# right and the method contradicted it. README.md uses `read -rs` for the agent-token path for
# the same reason. The trailing `echo` restores the newline that `-s` swallows. Found by a
# second-machine dogfood on the shipped installer; nothing here is executed by a gate.
printf '  read -rs LINK; echo    # paste the link, then press Enter (stays hidden)\n'
printf '  printf %%s "$LINK" | cswarm accept --link-stdin\n\n'
printf 'The link is piped in rather than passed as an argument, and read hides it as you paste,\n'
printf 'because either would leave a live capability on screen, in your shell history, or in\n'
printf 'the process list.\n'
printf '\nNo invite? Make your own workspace. It is free and takes no card:\n\n'
printf '  https://commonswarm.com/app\n\n'
# `<workspace name>`: this must match the placeholder `cswarm --help` prints for this
# command, because a line shown to someone who has not run --help yet must match what they
# will read when they do. The two move together or not at all.
#
# It said `<project name>` until 2026-08-10. The drift this comment described -- the CLI
# saying "project" while the site and docs said "workspace" -- was MEASURED at 16 project to
# 11 workspace in cli.ts prose, and settled in favour of "workspace": that is what the schema
# (swarm.workspaces), the flag (--workspace-id) and the design doc already say. Someone else's
# "project" is left alone: Supabase's project base URL and OpenCode's project cwd are their
# nouns, not ours.
