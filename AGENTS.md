## Done means done

Not half done. Not done except for the part you decided to skip. And not a report about how it will be done.

Five things asked means five things delivered, no matter how long they'll take. If the fifth is genuinely blocked, finish the other four and name the blocker in one sentence. The specific blocker. Not "this needs more investigation."

## Act. Don't ask.

Reversible and cheap? Do it, then tell me. Research, data pulls, analysis, drafts, refactors inside the scope I gave you, testing an API. A question costs me more than a re-run costs you.

Ask first only for: anything reaching an audience, anything we cannot undo, anything expensive.

Something is broken? Fix it. Reporting an issue you could have fixed turns your work into my to-do list.

## A question is a question

When I ask a question, answer it. Do not implement it.

"Should we use X?" is not "migrate everything to X." "What would it take to add Y?" is not "add Y."

When in doubt, assume it's a question. Answer first. Act when I say go.

## Speed (Opus 5 only)

When running as Opus 5: optimize for wall-clock speed. Finish tasks quickly.

- Parallelize aggressively. Independent tasks run at the same time, never one after another — batch tool calls, spawn subagents concurrently.
- Delegate by complexity: Sonnet 5 subagents for routine work (search, bulk edits, boilerplate, verification), Opus 5 subagents for hard reasoning that can run independently.
- Keep working in the main thread while subagents run — don't sit idle waiting on them.
- Don't over-deliberate. Enough info to act = act. No long option surveys for decisions with an obvious default.
- Speed never trades away quality: same rigor, same verification, same "done means done". If parallelizing risks a worse result, slow down.
- No conflicts from parallelism: never let two subagents touch the same files or overlapping scope. Split work by non-overlapping boundaries; merge and reconcile results in the main thread.

## Short responses

It's been a long day and my brain is fried, talk to me like I'm 5.

Small words, short sentences, short paragraphs. If you have to use a big word, explain it right after. Only return what's actually necessary.

Just tell me what you did, did it work, what do I do now.

If I have to decide something: 2 options max, the context I need to pick fast, and which one you'd go with.

Keep paths and commands exact.

Always use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English when you talk to me.

**CommonSwarm** is a coordination service for people and AI agents working side by side. It has the
`cswarm` CLI, a backend on one Hetzner server in Falkenstein, and the website at https://commonswarm.com on that same server. Agents post
short, immutable signals of intent so collaborators do not step on each other. A signal never claims,
blocks, or closes a task.

Status: **P3-1, open free tier**. `SWARM_SELF_SERVE=1` is live in production; `/app` owns signup and
the workspace, while `/start` is a compatibility handoff. Node >= 22. The old "no web UI" and
"invite-only" claims are retired.

The product was renamed from `coswarm` to CommonSwarm / `cswarm` on 2026-07-27. Prose says
CommonSwarm; anything a user types says `cswarm`. Do not rename the paired build identifier
`__COSWARM_VERSION__` in `scripts/build-release.sh` and `src/cli.ts`. The PostgreSQL schema
`swarm.`, `SWARM_*` variables, and separate local `swarm` CLI are unrelated names.

The repo moved on 2026-08-10 by creating `Ridge-io/commonswarm`, not by renaming the old repo. Its
history was rewritten, so every SHA changed. `Ridge-io/cloud-swarm` was deleted on 2026-08-17.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm install` | Installs dependencies; `prepare` builds the package. |
| `npm run build` | `tsc` → `dist/`; wipes `dist/` first and makes `dist/cli.js` executable after. |
| `npm test` | Pure gate for every file named in the literal `test` script; no network or database. |
| `npm run test:p1-cli` | Pure gate that globs `tests/p1-cli/**/*.test.ts`; no network or database. |
| `npm run test:p1-local` | Runs the six files named in the script; needs local Supabase and an exclusive DB slot. |
| `npm run test:p1-server` | Globs `tests/p1-server/**/*.test.ts`; needs local Supabase and an exclusive DB slot. |
| `npm run test:uxtest` | Runs the cross-machine UX harness. |
| `npm run check:tests` | Typechecks `tests/` as well as `src/`. |
| `npm run db:start` / `db:stop` / `db:reset` / `db:status` | Controls local Supabase; needs Docker. |
| `npm run build:command-core` | Regenerates the edge-function protocol bundle. |
| `npm run check:edge` | Runs `deno check` on `command`, `read`, `capability`, and `activity`; needs Deno. |

The site is a separate project: `cd site && npm install && npm run build` (Astro 7, static output).

## Layout

```
src/protocol/   pure authority core — reducer, events, commands; no I/O
src/cloud/      client side — auth, signals, workspaces, transport
src/cli.ts      cswarm CLI surface
supabase/       migrations + Deno edge functions: command, read, capability, activity
tests/          pure, CLI, local-Supabase, and server-Supabase suites
scripts/        build and verification helpers
site/           Astro site — hand-written CSS, no Tailwind
docs/design/    SWARM-CLOUD.md is the canonical spec; on conflict it wins
docs/evidence/  committed artifacts backing completion claims
```

## Reachable traps

**A test file runs only when a package script names or globs it.** `npm test` is a literal list;
`test:p1-cli` and `test:p1-server` glob their trees; `test:p1-local` names six files. A new file in
`tests/support/` does not run unless the script names it. Check the gate and report it when adding a test.

**Edge functions are outside `tsc`.** `tsconfig.json` includes only `src/**/*.ts`. Run
`npm run check:edge`; it names the current four entrypoints (`command`, `read`, `capability`,
`activity`) and no other gate runs it. A fifth function would need adding, and a stale generated
protocol bundle can still typecheck.

**`supabase functions serve` gives Deno only the values in `--env-file`.** Parent `env` values do not
reach it. Add every environment-gated test value to the temporary env file used by the server suite.

**`supabase/functions/_shared/protocol.js` is generated.** Edit `src/protocol/index.ts`, then run
`npm run build:command-core`; `pretest:p1-server` also regenerates it. Never hand-edit the bundle.

**A shared checkout can be on another agent's branch.** Before commit, run
`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` and inspect `git worktree list`. Use one writer per branch/worktree;
never push a branch you do not own. Run `scripts/branch-audit.sh` before pruning local branches.

**`scratchpad/` is gitignored.** Put evidence that must survive in `docs/evidence/` or `docs/org/`.

**Push is a hint; the row is the truth; a status that says push must be subscribed now.** A wake
event is a latency hint. `claim_agent_inbox` reads `swarm.signal_deliveries`. `cswarm listen status`
may report `mode: push` only while the Realtime socket is subscribed.

**The listener never starts a model; a lane that adds a worker is wrong by construction.** The
only live `--route` is `main`. A signal wakes the seat's own session. The listener claims the
delivery into that seat's queue. It does not start Grok, Claude, Codex, or OpenCode.

**The source suites never load the shipped bundle.** `npm test` and `test:p1-cli` run TypeScript
through tsx. A lane that changes module loading must run `scripts/build-release.sh` and check its
EXIT CODE (it runs the artifact and fails on a bad build). `cmd | grep` hides the exit code —
that is how 0.1.62 shipped.

## Session continuity

Read the newest `docs/org/*-RESUME-HERE.md` on `main` before re-deriving work:

```sh
ls -1 docs/org/*RESUME-HERE.md | sort | tail -1
```

The resume file must land on `main`. Write it for a cold successor and include: refs by hash; what is
LIVE versus merely written; the next file, line, or command; what is deliberately DEFERRED; what was
NOT established; and corrections to published claims, including the retired wording when readers may
still meet it. Record operator-relevant facts in a durable artifact as you learn them, not only in chat.

## Sprint hygiene: every lane leaves nothing behind

Measured 2026-09-02: `git worktree list` had 46 entries and 45 local branches before a cleanup lane pruned
them; the operator ruled that this is part of every sprint, not a chore for later. The lead runs it; a Codex
lane does the work.

1. **One worktree per lane, under the session scratchpad**, branch `lane/<name>`, `node_modules` symlinked
   from the main checkout. Never a checkout of the shared tree. Arms get their own detached worktree each.
2. **Merge, then delete.** When a lane's commits are on `main` (or on a `release/<v>` branch that reaches
   `main`), remove its worktree at once and delete the branch as soon as `git cherry main <branch>` shows
   zero `+` lines. A branch that still shows `+` lines is the only copy of something: keep it and say why in
   the ledger.
3. **A release ends on one branch.** Before writing "released", `git worktree list` shows the main checkout
   only and `git branch` shows `main` only. Dirty worktrees that are not yours: save `git diff` to
   `docs/evidence/<date>-cleanup/<branch>.patch`, then remove.
4. **Cleanup is a lane** (`scripts/branch-audit.sh` first, then `git worktree prune`, `worktree remove`,
   `branch -d`), with a protected list of live lanes and a report of every removal and every keep.
5. **Kill your processes.** No `codex exec`, arm, or test runner of yours survives the sprint; `pgrep -f
   <your scratchpad id>` must be empty before you report done.

## Verification

Read `docs/org/2026-07-26-simplification-state.md` before a nontrivial change.

- **Measure the artifact, not its name.** Resolve the path, URL, ref, or symlink first.
- **Run a positive control on the same invocation.** A probe that cannot fail proves nothing. Use
  `scripts/probe-check.sh` and `scripts/path-check.sh` rather than rebuilding their checks.
- **Enumerate, don't pattern-match.** List the set and count it; a grep against a guessed path can make a confident zero.
- **Pushed ≠ landed ≠ applied.** State which one you established.
- **Review the decision set, not only its items.** Individually correct rulings can be unsafe together.
- **Corrections go in the artifact, not in a message.** Preserve retired wording when later readers may meet it.
- **D-036 model-inversion gate:** every SHA-changing lane needs two substantive arms on the exact SHA:
  an exact review and an independent cross-family inversion. Choose two different families from Codex,
  Grok, and Gemini, in that preference order; the author's family is excluded. One arm, an empty PASS,
  or output without reasoning is not a review. If either arm changes the SHA, rerun both.
  - Call Grok headlessly as `grok -p "<prompt>"`. Do not pipe into it (`Device not configured`), and do
    not use macOS `timeout` (exit 127). Re-probe tool availability before stating it.
  - **Two of YOUR OWN arm invocations alive at once interleave one output file** into unreadable text
    that still matches a `VERDICT:` grep — a garbled file is not a review. Guard before starting one,
    but scope the guard to your own session (`pgrep -f <your session id>` filtered to the tool): a bare
    `pgrep -f grok` also matches other agents' runs on a shared host and blocks your work for no reason.
  - For every arm, assert that a `VERDICT` line is present. Absence of an error string is not success;
    a reply without a verdict is not a review, so the lane still owes that arm.
- **A claim about a running listener needs a live control.** Tests with a fake bridge and two review arms
  passed a lane whose status fields were `null` on a real detached listener (v0.1.46). A lane that changes
  what a live listener reports must start one with `--state-dir <temp>` and paste its status JSON.
- **Durable by default.** Operator- or system-read state belongs in Postgres. Process memory is only a
  cache or a home for state that can be derived again; serverless invocations do not share it.

State what you did **not** establish alongside what you did.

## D-053: never branch on `error.message`

`error.message` is presentation. Classify with a named error class, a stable code we assign, or our own
state; a caller's `AbortSignal` is authoritative for cancellation. Normalize raw stream failures to a
typed code at the boundary. Name every producer that can populate a message before clearing a classifier.

Measured instance: an ACP child's JSON-RPC prose was copied into an error, and a retry regex matched that
prose. With the same type and code, the provider could change whether CommonSwarm re-prompted it.

## Claim controls prove stability, not truth

If a test asserts a user-readable string, it reviews a **claim**, not only behavior. A control can
discriminate and still pin the wrong claim. Check each claim against what the underlying system does,
not against another artifact that repeats it. Enumerate every surface in the claim family—including
tests, comments, and docs—then read each statement clause by clause.

Measured instance: sign-out copy said it ended every session, and a test required `/every session/`.
The endpoint revoked refresh tokens but could not revoke issued access JWTs. The green mutation control
therefore defended a false claim, and a sibling clause survived until the whole claim family was swept.

## An enumeration inside a message must be generated, not typed

**If a user-facing string lists things the code enforces — required fields, accepted commands, valid
options, supported providers — that list must come from the same constant the enforcement reads.**
A typed list is a claim with no control on it, and it drifts the moment the enforcement changes.

Measured four times in one release cycle (v0.1.48-v0.1.50), each time AFTER two review arms passed:
a receipt label that named the wrong delivery outcome, twice; a remedy naming `claude login`, a verb
that does not exist (`claude auth login` does); and a credential error whose own field list said
`agent_token (required)` while the parser rejected a file that had exactly that and nothing else.

The arms reliably catch wrong logic. They do not catch a wrong LIST inside a correct-looking
sentence, because reading it requires re-deriving the enforcement — which is the work the shared
constant removes. Export the set; build the sentence from it; add a test that fails when they differ.

## Honesty is not sufficient

When a command returns while work continues, state what the reader must do next. Exit 0 and a success-shaped
response can make a true state word easy to skip. Apply this to transitional states, partial success, and
accepted-but-not-applied work.

Measured instance: `cswarm listen stop` returned `state: "stopping"`, exit 0, and readers treated teardown
as complete. The durable form says: `This is still in progress. Confirm with: cswarm listen status …`.

## A negative result must reach the path it claims to test

Before recording a negative, ask: **what would this probe return if the feature were present and working?**
If the answer is the same, the probe did not measure the feature. Show that the intended gate was reached;
mutation testing proves a control can fail, not that it fails for the claimed reason.

Measured instance: a control used `--not-a-real-flag`; the parser rejected it before the validator. It
failed whether the validator worked or not, so its negative result was not evidence about validation.

## Onboarding: ask for the minimum, detect the rest

1. **Every field must justify itself.** If context can determine or default it, remove it; put rare choices in settings.
2. **Detect rather than ask.** Let agents inspect their environment, repo, or APIs.
3. **Chrome is not information.** Remove borders, panels, headings, and helper text that only restate labels.
4. **Simplicity is an engineering result.** A short form can need more work behind it; budget for that.
5. **Measure fields and steps.** Record a reason for every addition.

Constraint: detection must not guess. `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` can be inherited by a Codex child and
mislabel it as Claude Code. Return a value or nothing; a wrong automatic answer is worse than the question.

## Writing for users

The product voice is plain and calm. CLI output says what just happened, what is now true, and what happens
next, so nobody has to check whether it worked. The benefit is agents coordinating so collaborators are
unblocked — never control, authority, or enforcement (that framing was retired as friction). Availability
copy asserts deployment state and lives in git: when a gate flips, grep every surface. Claims about what
CommonSwarm does must hold for BOTH the hosted workspace and the optional local listener.

## Writing: modifiers and invented contrasts

Use the shortest precise statement. Remove modifiers such as *actual, real, true, clear, honest, genuine,
main, key,* or *important* when they add no fact. Do not invent an opposing view for an “X, not Y” contrast,
and never imply that someone argued a view they did not introduce.

## Workspace brain and releases

The CommonSwarm workspace brain (`cswarm brain ls | get <topic>`) holds live doctrine that moves faster than
this file: `brain-how-to` (its constitution), `false-success-signals`, `shared-host`, `listener-attended`,
`agent-restart`, `releases`. Read the relevant topic before a big task; write durable findings with
`cswarm brain put`. Cite topics by NAME only, never by section number or item count.

**Save the durable object, then name it.** A finding that outlives the task belongs in a topic, not
only in a signal body: `cswarm brain put <topic>`. Naming the topic in a signal now costs the reader
nothing — the web app turns a topic name into a control that opens that topic, Markdown-rendered, so
"see shared-host" is worth more to a human than a paraphrase of it. Write the slug; case does not
matter. A slug that carries punctuation — as most topic names do — is recognised in ordinary prose,
but not inside a fenced block, a link, or a URL, where the text is left as typed. A slug
that is one ordinary word (`releases`, `roadmap`) is recognised only when backticks hold that word
and nothing else, because a topic named `roadmap` must not turn every use of that word into a link,
and a topic named `brain` must not put a control inside `cswarm brain put`. A name that is not a
live topic stays plain text, and a click re-reads the topic list before it opens anything, so
within the workspace it was made in it never lands on a topic that has since been deleted. A click
whose workspace the reader has left opens nothing at all. The separator set itself is
`BRAIN_SLUG_SEPARATORS` in `site/src/lib/brain-links.ts`; this paragraph deliberately does not
repeat it, so the two cannot drift.
See `docs/design/2026-09-04-BRAIN-LINKS-IN-SIGNALS.md`.

Releasing: the ritual lives in the brain topic `releases` and the newest `docs/org/*-RESUME-HERE.md`. The
CLI version on `/download` is derived from the root `package.json` through `site/src/lib/release.ts`; bump
with `npm version --no-git-tag-version <v>` so the lockfile stays in sync (`npm --prefix site test` rejects
drift). Every SHA-changing lane needs both D-036 arms before it lands.

## Production is the box

Production is one Hetzner server, `yulan-vps-1`, in Falkenstein. It serves `api.commonswarm.com` and the website at https://commonswarm.com.

The Supabase project `cloud-swarm-dev` (`ukezjcnxjvkpkeezxaew`) is deleted. The Vercel project `coswarm-site` is deleted.

Do not run these commands for CommonSwarm: `supabase db push`, `supabase functions deploy`, `supabase link`, anything with `--linked`, `supabase projects api-keys`, or `vercel deploy`.

Not established: there is no written procedure yet for how a schema migration, or a new stack or edge-function version, reaches the box. See `docs/org/2026-09-22-PRODUCTION-BOX-RESUME-HERE.md`.

Local work uses `npm run db:start` at `127.0.0.1:54321`. That local Supabase CLI stack runs the server test suites.

## Deploying the site

The website is static files served by Caddy on `yulan-vps-1`. From the repo root:

```sh
deploy/site/deploy.sh yulan-vps-1
```

The script takes one SSH host. It refuses to run when `site/.env` is missing. `deploy/site/validate-site-env.mjs` requires non-empty `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, requires the anon key to be a JWT, and refuses a `service_role` payload. It does not print the key. Set `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://api.commonswarm.com`. Never put a service-role key under `site/`.

The script archives `HEAD`, removes `site/dist`, runs `npm ci` and `npm run build` in `site/`, and refuses the upload when `site/dist/start/index.html` is missing or its `commonswarm:url` meta value is empty. It rsyncs that directory to `/srv/commonswarm/site/releases/<release>.tmp` on the host with `rsync -a --delete` (no `--chmod`), then runs `deploy/site/finalize-release.sh` over SSH. The release name is UTC time, a 12-character git SHA, and 16 random hex characters. Finalize keeps previous `/_astro` files, sets directories to `755` and files to `644`, and switches `/srv/commonswarm/site/current` with `ln -sfn` plus `mv -Tf`. The script keeps the five newest releases. A prune error after the switch is a warning.

Dry runs:

```sh
deploy/site/deploy.sh --dry-run --dist <dist-directory>
deploy/site/deploy.sh --dry-run --npm-ci <site-directory>
deploy/site/deploy.sh --dry-run --release-name
```

Roll back a site release on the server by moving the `current` symlink:

```sh
cd /srv/commonswarm/site
ln -sfn releases/RELEASE_TO_RESTORE current.next
mv -Tf current.next current
```

Check the live site after a deploy. Expected status codes are 200 for `/` and `/install.sh`, and 404 for `/nope.sh`. The backend URL output is non-empty. The service-role marker count is 0.

```sh
U=https://commonswarm.com
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' "$U"
curl -sS "$U" | grep -c '<some string that MUST be there>'
curl -sS "$U" | grep -c '<the thing that must be GONE>'
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' "$U/install.sh"
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' "$U/nope.sh"
curl -sS "$U/start" | grep -o 'commonswarm:url" content="[^"]*"'
curl -sS "$U/start" | grep -c 'InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSI'
```

The runbook is `deploy/site/RUNBOOK.md`. Astro publishes template `<!-- comments -->`; frontmatter comments are stripped. Astro does not remove stale output; the deploy script removes `site/dist` in the clean archive before the build.

## zsh: brace every revision-with-path

Always write `${rev}:path`, never `$rev:path`; zsh can mangle the latter before Git sees it, sometimes
without an error. The exact double-quoted construct `"$R:Xzzz"` was measured one letter at a time:

```
MANGLED:  a c e h l q r s t u   and   A P Q
SAFE:     everything else
```

Brace every revision-with-path even when the path begins with a measured safe letter.
