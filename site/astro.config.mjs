// Static output on purpose. Interactive account and workspace behaviour runs in the browser

// `site` is required for canonical URLs and the OG tags in Base.astro to resolve to
// absolute URLs. It is the real, live domain: commonswarm.com serves this site through
// Cloudflare DNS, and the install URL (commonswarm.com/install.sh) is live and installs
// cswarm from the public yulanventures/commonswarm releases. The superseded note here — "a
// placeholder until the real domain is decided; the CTA install URL is likewise not live
// yet" — is dead (2026-07-29); both launch blockers it tracked are resolved.
// WHERE THE BACKEND POINTER COMES FROM, AND WHY THERE IS NO `env:` BLOCK BELOW.
// The web app reads PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (site/src/lib/
// commonswarm.ts:53-54). Vite exposes any PUBLIC_-prefixed variable to client code without
// being declared anywhere, so nothing has to be listed here for that to work.
//
// No `env: { schema: ... }` is declared ON PURPOSE. This build must succeed with neither
// variable set — that is the honest "not pointed at a backend" build, which renders the
// whole site and lets the app route say so (commonswarm.ts:55 returns null, and the UI
// treats null as a state, not an error). Declaring them as required config would move that
// decision from runtime to build time and turn a documented state into a broken build.
// If you ever add a schema here, make both entries optional, or read WEB-ONBOARDING.md
// first and change your mind.
