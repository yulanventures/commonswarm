/*
 * Build the site once per SIGN-IN-PROVIDER STATE, so the copy can be measured in a state the
 * live deployment is not in.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Which providers a build renders is read from a deployment's own
 * /auth/v1/settings at build time (site/src/lib/auth-providers.ts). That is the right design
 * and it has one consequence: every control that reads `site/dist` measures ONE state, the one
 * api.commonswarm.com happened to be in when the build ran. On 2026-09-05 that state is
 * `github: true, google: false`, so a sentence that is only wrong once Google is on cannot go
 * red, and "the copy passes in both states" was a claim with no control on it. A review arm
 * found a real offender under it: the privacy policy's `Google LLC` processor bullet named one
 * provider while the build rendered two.
 *
 * HOW IT MEASURES THE REAL PATH. It does not fake the settings module or stub a function. It
 * starts a GoTrue-shaped HTTP server on 127.0.0.1, points PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL at it, and runs
 * the real `astro build`. So `enabledProvidersForBuild`, `providersFromSettings`, the real
 * fetch, the real components and the real templates all run — the same code path a deploy
 * takes, differing only in which answer comes back. A stub whose 404 branch was reachable
 * would have proved nothing; the server answers ONLY AUTH_SETTINGS_PATH and 404s everything
 * else, so a build that asked for something else fails rather than quietly using a default.
 *
 * THE STATES ARE GENERATED FROM AUTH_PROVIDERS. Three, whatever the array holds: nothing
 * enabled, the first provider alone, and every provider the array names. Adding a provider
 * therefore widens the "every" state instead of needing a fourth fixture, and no state is a
 * hand-typed list of ids that could drift from the array.
