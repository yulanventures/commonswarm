/*
 * The browser client. This file is the whole of the web app's contact with the backend.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Until now the only way into CommonSwarm was `cswarm login` in a
 * terminal, and the web surface was a static picture of a product. The operator's decision
 * is that the web UI is the PRIMARY onboarding path for both humans and agents — a human
 * signs in here, gets a workspace, and hands their agent a credential — with the CLI
 * becoming what agents run rather than what humans install.
 *
 * STATIC OUTPUT IS NOT A BLOCKER, WHICH IS THE NON-OBVIOUS PART. astro.config.mjs sets
 * `output: "static"` and that stays. Supabase Auth, PostgREST and the edge functions are all
 * callable from the browser with an anon key and a user JWT, so the entire app runs
 * client-side against the same API the CLI uses. No SSR, no adapter, no server to operate,
 * and the deploy remains a folder of files on a CDN.
 *
 * THE ANON KEY IS NOT A SECRET. It is a public identifier that says which project to talk
 * to; every Supabase browser app ships one. Authorisation is the user's JWT plus row-level
 * security plus the edge functions' own checks — none of which this key weakens. Do not
 * "fix" it by hiding it, and do NOT ever put a service-role key here.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MAY NOT DO. It must never claim a capability the deployment does not have.
 * `create_workspace` is gated server-side on SWARM_SELF_SERVE. Production enables it, while a
 * self-hosted or paused deployment can still refuse signup. That is a state the UI has to
 * render honestly, not an error to hide — see SignupRefused below.

 * Start an OAuth sign-in. THE ONLY PLACE A PROVIDER STRING REACHES SUPABASE.

 * provider are built from that same array, so a button can never ask for a provider this
 * function would refuse, and a refused provider can never appear in copy. Do not add a second
 * `signInWithOAuth` call with a literal provider — site/src/components/auth/
 * provider-buttons.observer.test.ts fails if one appears.
 *
 * GitHub matches the CLI (src/cloud/auth.ts sets provider=github), so the two surfaces
 * resolve the same account for the same person. See signInWithEmail below for the door that
 * does not require a developer account at all.
 *
 * A PROVIDER THE DEPLOYMENT HAS NOT ENABLED DOES NOT REACH THE CATCH BLOCK BELOW, AND THAT IS
 * WHY THE FLIP ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. `signInWithOAuth` builds the authorize URL in the
 * browser and navigates to it; it does not ask GoTrue anything first. So a provider that is
 * off in GoTrue produces no client error at all — the browser lands on the
 * API host and the reader sees raw JSON. Measured 2026-09-04:
 *

 *   400 {"code":400,"error_code":"validation_failed",
 *        "msg":"Unsupported provider: provider is not enabled"}
 *
 * No handler here can improve that page, which is why nothing chooses the buttons but the
 * deployment itself: ProviderButtons.astro reads GoTrue's /auth/v1/settings at build time, so
 * a provider that is off cannot get a button. Change GoTrue on the server, then rebuild
 * and publish with deploy/site/deploy.sh. docs/design/2026-09-04-GOOGLE-SIGNIN.md gives the order.

 * the FEATURE is off rather than like the user is new. That exact response sent one
 * investigation down the wrong path.
 *
 * NO ENUMERATION SIGNAL. Whether the address was already registered is never returned, and
 * the caller must not infer it: the response is the same either way, which is what stops this
 * form becoming a way to test which addresses have accounts.

/**
 * Workspaces the signed-in user is a live member of.
 *
 * ★ THIS QUERIED A COLUMN THAT DOES NOT EXIST. It selected `workspace_name` from
 * swarm_read.member_profiles, whose columns are workspace_id, user_id and display_name
 * (20260724000002_status_workspaces.sql:18-21). The name lives on swarm_read.workspaces,
 * which is the view this should have used all along. PostgREST answers an unknown column
 * with an error rather than silently omitting it, so every call threw — and the signup
 * flow uses this as its duplicate-workspace guard, meaning the guard could never have run.
 *
 * The membership gate is in the view (`WHERE swarm.is_member(...)`), so a non-member gets
 * an empty set rather than an error: no one can probe whether a workspace id exists.
 * archived_at is filtered here because an archived workspace is not somewhere you can work.
