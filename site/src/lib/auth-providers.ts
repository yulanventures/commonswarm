/*
 * The one list of OAuth sign-in providers, and the one place that decides which of them a
 * build renders.
 *
 * WHY A MODULE FOR TWO STRINGS. AGENTS.md records four measured releases (v0.1.48-v0.1.50)
 * where a user-facing sentence enumerated something the code enforces — required fields, a
 * login verb, a delivery outcome — and drifted from the enforcement, each time AFTER two
 * review arms passed. A typed list inside a correct-looking sentence is a claim with no
 * control on it. So: the button labels, any sentence that names the providers, and the
 * enforcement that decides which `provider` string reaches Supabase all read THIS array.
 * Nothing else may name a provider in a string literal.
 *
 * THE ID IS THE SUPABASE PROVIDER STRING ON PURPOSE. GoTrue takes `provider=github` and
 * `provider=google` verbatim (measured 2026-09-04 against https://api.commonswarm.com — see
 * `/auth/v1/settings`, which enumerates every provider GoTrue knows). Keeping one field
 * removes the chance of a mapping table disagreeing with the labels beside it.
 *
 * WHAT IS ENABLED IS THE DEPLOYMENT'S ANSWER, NOT OURS. `AUTH_PROVIDERS` is everything the
 * code can render. Which of them a build actually renders is read from GoTrue's own
 * `/auth/v1/settings`, so a button can exist only if the deployment it points at reports that
 * provider as enabled. There is no flag to set, and therefore no way to publish a button that
 * leads to "Unsupported provider: provider is not enabled". See
 * docs/design/2026-09-04-GOOGLE-SIGNIN.md.
 *
 * RETIRED 2026-09-04, kept here because the design doc and the first commit message name it:
 * an earlier draft chose the rendered set from a `PUBLIC_SWARM_AUTH_PROVIDERS` build
 * variable. That is a hand-set flag; it let an operator publish a button for a provider that
 * was still off in GoTrue, and the reader of that button got raw JSON. The variable is
 * gone and nothing reads it.
