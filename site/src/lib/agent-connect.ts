/*
 * Turning a signed-in human into an agent's credential issuer.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A BROWSER FILE AT ALL. `create_agent_principal` and `mint_agent_token` are both
 * in HUMAN_ONLY_COMMANDS (src/protocol/workspace-commands.ts:106-116), and the reducer refuses
 * them outright when the presenting credential is an agent one. That rule was written for
 * security — a compromised worker must not be able to issue itself a successor — and it turns
 * out to be exactly the shape onboarding wants: the person mints in a browser, once, and hands
 * the result to whatever agent they already run. Nothing here may weaken that. In particular
 * this file never accepts an agent credential as its caller: every call takes the human's
 * GoTrue Session.
 *
 * THE SEQUENCE MIRRORS THE CLI, because the CLI is the working reference and the server has
 * one command surface, not two:
 *
 *   1. register_device      src/cloud/auth.ts:342 — pre-route, no workspace_id, no stream.
 *   2. create_agent_principal   src/cli.ts:1145 (`cswarm principal create`).
 *   3. mint_agent_token         src/cli.ts:1173 (`cswarm token mint`).
 *
 * Step 1 is not optional and is the step that is easy to miss from a browser. The command
 * function checks the mint's device binding against swarm.devices directly
 * (supabase/functions/command/index.ts:3241-3250): the device row must exist, be owned by the
 * calling human, and not be revoked, or the mint is a bare 403 with no explanation. So the
 * browser has to be a registered device before it can mint anything.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MAY NOT DO. The minted credential is returned to the caller and never touched
 * again: it is not logged, not stored, not put in a URL or a query string, and never
 * interpolated into an Error message. A `swm_agt_` string exists in exactly one place in this
 * module — the return value of mintAgentCredential — and every failure path is constructed
 * before or without it.

 *
 * The rationale it carried is still true and now lives where it is enforced: a work session
 * runs for days while a bearer lives at most a day, so the token stays short and rotates
 * rather than becoming a month-long secret on a developer's machine (SWARM-CLOUD.md §2.3).
 * What was false was the DATE. This page never asked the server for that horizon and the
 * server never returned it here; the number was right only while the server's default
 * happened to agree, and the agent's prompt printed it as "rotate it until <date>".
 *

 * here is what lets a credential minted in a browser be piped into `--agent-token-stdin` with

 * "malformed" for BOTH arms because the fixture had the wrong key set, and identical output from
 * both arms is a broken instrument, not a result.
 *
 * The claim it makes is still wrong and is tracked as D-088: the run binding and attribution are
 * real, the TASK SCOPE IS NOT — `task_id` is generated here (see below) because a person connecting
 * an agent has not picked a work item, nothing restricts the agent to it, and
 * `supabase/functions/_shared/agent-auth.ts` never reads it. Fixing it needs the CLI to accept both
