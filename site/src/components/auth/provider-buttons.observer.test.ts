/*
 * Controls on the provider list.
 *
 * The load-bearing one is "the rendered buttons and the provider list agree". AGENTS.md
 * records four releases in a row (v0.1.48-v0.1.50) where a user-facing enumeration drifted
 * from the enforcement AFTER two review arms passed, because reading such a sentence means
 * re-deriving the enforcement by hand. These tests do that re-derivation mechanically.
 *
 * THEY MEASURE THE BUILT HTML, NOT THE TEMPLATE. A template that loops over the array proves
 * nothing on its own — a hand-written extra button beside the loop would still render. The
 * dist file is the artifact a visitor receives, so that is what is compared against the
 * array. Run `npm run build` in site/ first; without it these fail for the wrong reason, and
 * the first test says so.
 *
 * WHAT THESE CONTROLS DO NOT REACH. Which providers a build renders is read from the
 * deployment's own /auth/v1/settings at build time, so the built page and the deployment
 * agree by construction. Re-checking that agreement here would measure the network, not the
 * code, so it is a deploy step instead — docs/design/2026-09-04-GOOGLE-SIGNIN.md carries the
 * curl with its positive control. What runs here is offline: the decision function against
 * recorded GoTrue bodies, and the rendering against the constant.
 *
 * THE SWEEP HAS A STATED BOUND, AND IT IS NOT A GAP. `SWEEP_CATCHES` below lists what the
 * hand-written-control sweep catches, generated from the very patterns and call names the
 * assertions use, and `SWEEP_DOES_NOT_CATCH` says what it does not. Read those two before
 * judging this file: the question they invite is "does the sweep do what it says", not "is a
 * regex over site/src complete". It is not, it cannot be, and four review rounds spent on
 * widening it produced one more bypass each time. The bound is written here and in step 6 of
 * docs/design/2026-09-04-GOOGLE-SIGNIN.md, and a control below keeps the two identical.
