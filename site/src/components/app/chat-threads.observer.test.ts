/**
 * The thread surface of the workspace app, measured in real Chrome against the built `/app` in
 * sample mode, plus the source and wire claims a browser cannot see.
 *
 * Reached by `npm --prefix site test` through the recursive component-observer glob.
 *
 * The claims this file defends, stated so a reader can check them against the system rather
 * than against another artifact that repeats them:
 *   1. The reply control is offered exactly where `resolveThreadRoot` would accept the root.
 *   2. Replies render COLLAPSED under their root, with a count that expands them in place.
 *   3. The reply bar names the root and the channel the root is in, and offers
 *      `broadcast_to_channel` only where there is a channel to broadcast to.
 *   4. A thread reply carries NO recipient: the To: row says so and is locked, and the wire
 *      body carries no `to`.
 *   5. Threads and the channel filter COMPOSE: a reply in #mobile reads under its root in
 *      #mobile and again in all-signals.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT ESTABLISH. Nothing here touches production or a real workspace: the
 * page runs in sample mode, so a reply is a local row and not a `post_signal`. The wire claim
 * below is about the body this client BUILDS, taken from the exported builder, compared byte
 * for byte against the bodies `tests/p1-server/chat-signals.test.ts` sends to a served edge.
 * That suite is where the server answers for the shape, and it needs a local Supabase this
 * lane did not take.
