/** Reached by `npm --prefix site test` through the recursive component-observer glob.
 *
 * The brain-link pass walks the tree the SANITIZER built and turns validated topic names into
 * buttons. This lane gave that tree four new places to walk: table headers, table cells, task
 * items, and sublists. `brain-links.observer.test.ts` covers paragraphs, code spans, links, and
 * fenced blocks; none of its fixture reaches a table or a task item, so the new constructs had no
 * control on them at all.
 *
 * What is under test is the BOUNDARY, not the feature: a topic name must not end up as a control
 * inside something that is meant to be opaque or verbatim, and the marker a task item owns must not
 * be swallowed into the control's own label -- a button reading "[ballot] shared-host" is a
 * checkbox the reader can click, which is exactly the shape the renderer refused to emit.
