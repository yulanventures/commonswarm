/** Reached by `npm --prefix site test` through the recursive component-observer glob.
 *
 * The renderer gained a table, a rule, strikethrough, and task items. Every one of them is a NEW
 * element in the message body, and none of them had a single line of CSS: the pure renderer tests
 * assert the HTML string and cannot see that.
 *
 * A table is the one that costs a reader something. A table of SHAs is wider than a phone, and a
 * default `display: table` grows past the message and pushes the whole PAGE sideways -- every other
 * message moves with it and the composer leaves the viewport. So this measures the shipped
 * stylesheet, not a copy of it: the fixture links exactly the stylesheets `dist/app/index.html`
 * links, and the assertions read geometry out of a real layout.
 *
 * There are TWO controls, because the fix has two halves and either one alone does nothing. Each is
 * a SEPARATE load of the same fixture at the same width with one half reverted -- a separate load
 * rather than an iframe on the measured page, because reading a frame's geometry across the frame
 * boundary reported a stale 320px under a loaded host and turned a real control into a flake:
 *
 *   `table`: the scroll rule reverted. The table must then widen its own document.
 *   `wrap`:  the cell `overflow-wrap` reverted to the `anywhere` the message body sets. The table
 *            must then NOT scroll -- it squeezes each column down instead, which is the state
 *            measured before this lane: at 320px the table reported no overflow at all.
 *
 * Without them a green result above would say nothing about whether either rule produced it -- the
 * table might simply be narrow.
