 *   1. A channel is an ADDRESS. all-signals shows every message, filed and unfiled.
 *   2. The narrowing is the QUERY's, so a channel shows the newest messages IN it.
 *   3. The composer posts where you are reading, with no added chrome and no body parsing.
 *   4. A refusal shows the server's sentence and is never read for meaning.
 *   5. A ?c= that names no readable channel never falls back to the unfiltered feed.
