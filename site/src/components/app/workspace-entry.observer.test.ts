   * TWO ASSERTIONS DIED HERE on 2026-07-30, by Lead7 ruling, not by bit-rot:
   *   - the rail's Add-an-agent door (`data-add-agent-rail`, hidden in sample mode)
   *   - the mobile collapse sync (`agentRail.open = !narrowRail.matches`)
   * Both locked the rail-resident agent roster, which the workspace-header roster
   * redesign moved OUT of the rail: the header carries a stack button that opens the
   * management dialog, and the rail must not grow with agent count. The successor
   * assertions live in header-roster.observer.test.ts, picked up by the same glob.
   */
  /*
   * RETIRED CLAIM (2026-09-03). These two assertions required a SECOND Sign out button in the
   * channel header (`dashboard__mobile-signout`), on the premise that "the desktop rail footer
   * disappears" at narrow widths. That premise stopped being true on 2026-08-19, when the rail
   * foot moved INTO the mobile top bar: measured at 390x844, the account trigger sits at the
   * top right and its menu still carries Sign out. The duplicate was 63px of a header row that
   * now has to fit on one line, so it was removed. The successor assertions below pin the door
   * that is actually there.
