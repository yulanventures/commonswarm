/**
 * The in-app update notice, driven in a real browser. Reached by `npm --prefix site test`
 * through the recursive component-observer glob.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS A CONTROL AND NOT A DEMO. The page decides by comparing what it is RUNNING
 * against what the server returns for its own URL. So the server here answers the two requests
 * differently on purpose: the DOCUMENT load always gets the real built page, and the page's own
 * POLL gets a variant. `sec-fetch-dest` is what separates them — `document` for the navigation,
 * `empty` for `fetch()` — and it is the browser that sets it, not the test.
 *
 * The variants are the cases the notice has to get right, including the ones where it must stay
 * quiet: a probe that 404s and a probe that lands on a page with no build in it (a login
 * redirect, an SSO interstitial) both mean the poll learned nothing.
