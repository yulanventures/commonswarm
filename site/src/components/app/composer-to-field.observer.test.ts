       Sample mode resolves a send with no await at all, so until now nothing in this file
       could act while a message was on the wire: both in-flight freezes were read out of the
       source, and the send's own teardown was never driven under a screen that moved.
       data-sample-send-delay gives the sample send a window and data-sample-send-fail
       makes it fail inside one. Both are sample-only.

       sawFlagUp IS THE POSITIVE CONTROL in every step below. It records that the box really
       was read-only at the moment the step acted, so a window that stopped opening fails on
       its own assertion instead of making the step vacuous. */
    /* THE IN-FLIGHT STEPS CLEAR WITHOUT THROWING. clearTo ends in settleChips, which aborts
       the whole measurement when the row will not empty — and a composer left frozen by a
       stuck send flag is exactly that state, so the defect these steps exist to catch would
       arrive as "no measurement" rather than on its own assertion. A review round measured
