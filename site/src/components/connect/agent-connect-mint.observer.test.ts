/**
 * What the connect page ASKS FOR when a person adds an agent, and what it BELIEVES about the
 * answer. Behavioural, not source-matched: it drives mintAgentCredential against a stubbed
 * transport and reads the JSON that would have gone on the wire.
 *
 * Operator decision 2026-09-04: an agent added here never expires. Two separate things have to
 * be true for that, and each has its own test below.
 *   1. The request must NAME the kind. Omitting it is not "no opinion" — the command function
 *      falls back to "timeboxed" with a 30-day horizon
 *      (supabase/functions/command/index.ts:2461-2464, 3419-3423), which is the month every
 *      web-added agent used to die after.
 *   2. `renewal_horizon_ms` must be ABSENT from the JSON. The validator accepts standing only
 *      when the key is `undefined` (index.ts:2467); a present `null` fails validation and
 *      returns 400 (index.ts:2521), even though the wire TYPE declares `number | null`.
 *      `JSON.stringify` drops undefined but SERIALISES null, so this is a real distinction and
 *      the test asserts on the serialised string, not on the object. An object assertion alone
 *      would pass for a body that gets rejected by the deployment.
 *
 * The rest measure that nothing is invented on the way back: grant kind and horizon are read
 * off the response, an unrecognised answer degrades to null rather than to a guess, and no
 * horizon is computed locally for either kind.
 *
 * Reached by `npm --prefix site test` via the glob 'src/components/**\/*.observer.test.ts'.
 * A file under src/lib/ would NOT run: that glob is 'src/lib/*.test.mjs' (site/package.json:11).
